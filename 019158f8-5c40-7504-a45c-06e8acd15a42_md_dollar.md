## Basic Concepts

## This chapter should help explain some fundamental aspects of the MPC and MPC Beats software.

The MPC workflow is quite different from traditional digital audio workstations (DAWs). In most typical DAWs, each track uses an instance of each instrument, and all tracks are always playing even if they don't contain any audio or MIDI information. Furthermore, your entire project needs to be arranged just as the resulting song would be.

This isn’t the case with the MPC software, which offers much more flexibility within your project. It’s important to understand some basic terms, though:

A sequence is a “building block” of a song. It contains multiple tracks that play at the same time like a normal DAW. In a project, you might create one sequence for your verse and another sequence for your chorus, alternating and/or repeating each one in a specific order to create the song. (A project can contain 128 sequences.)

A track is a layer in a sequence. There are two types of tracks:

MIDI tracks consist of MIDI data only, no audio data. These tracks produce sound by using programs, described below. Unlike a normal DAW, each MIDI track exists only in its sequence. The advantage of this is not having to manage empty or unwanted tracks across all of your sequences-each sequence contains only the tracks you want to use in it. If you want to use the same track across multiple sequences, you can copy the track from one sequence into another. (A sequence can contain 128 MIDI tracks [up to 8 for MPC Beats])

Audio tracks consist of a recorded audio signal, like a traditional DAW. These tracks do not use programs because the audio is already contained in the track. Also, unlike MIDI tracks, audio tracks are present in every sequence in the project, even if the tracks themselves are empty. (A sequence can contain 128 audio tracks. [up to 2 for MPC Beats])

A program is a preset through which MIDI tracks are routed. Programs may contain audio samples that are triggered when tracks play through them, producing the sound you want on that track. Programs are independent of tracks and sequences, so you can set multiple tracks to use the same program (unlike normal DAWs where each track requires its own set of samples or plugin). Furthermore, you can use the same program/programs across multiple sequences. (A project can contain 128 programs.)

Each program can be played using the 16 pads (across eight pad banks, which gives you access to 128 pads in each program). Each pad plays a MIDI note when you press it, but that MIDI note will trigger something different for each program. For instance, in drum programs, the pads are assigned to samples-one pad could trigger a kick drum sound and another could trigger a snare drum sound-whereas in plugin programs, each pad triggers a MIDI note that plays the corresponding pitch of its assigned instrument plugin.

Here's a diagram to illustrate an example of how these pieces could work together:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_13_648178.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_13_648178.jpg)

Please take a look at the following Tutorial chapter, as well. It will walk you through the creation of a short song to show you some of the MPC software's most important features.

## Tutorial

This chapter is a walkthrough of the creation of a song in the MPC software. To get the most out of this chapter, we recommend reproducing each of the described steps. The previous Basic Concepts chapter may also help you understand what we're asking you to do in this tutorial.

On the following pages we will create a short song to show you some of the MPC software’s most important features.

Make sure you have completed all of the steps described in Introduction $>$ Setup. This includes:

- Installing the most current drivers and software.

- Connecting your MPC hardware to a power outlet using the included power adapter and powering it on.

- Opening and authorizing your MPC software.

## Creating a Drum Kit

Let's start by making a simple drum kit.

By default, the Browser is shown on the right side of the window.

To show or hide the Browser, do one of the following:

- In the lower-right corner of the window, click the six-rectangles icon, list icon, or hard-drive icon.

- In the upper-left corner of the window, click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, and go to View $>$ Browser and click: Hidden (to hide the Browser), File Browser (to show files in the Browser), Expansion Browser (to show your Expansions in the Browser), or Media Browser (to show your media in the Browser).

Use the Browser controls to navigate to where your drum sounds are located:

- To browse your files by location, select the File Browser.

- To move up one folder level, click the up arrow (个) next to the file path.

- To select a file or folder, click it once.

- To enter a folder, double-click it.

- To load a sample directly to a pad, click and drag the sample onto a pad in the lower half of the window.

- To load a selected file to the project's sample pool, double-click it. If the file is a sample, it will be loaded to the project's sample pool. If the file is a project, it will be loaded in its entirety (you will be asked if you want to close your current project).

- To load all files in a selected folder, click and drag the folder onto anywhere in the window outside of the Browser.

- To preview a selected sound, click and hold Play (D) in the lower-left corner of the Browser.

- To enable or disable the audition function and set its volume level, click the volume icon in the lower-left corner of the Browser. Click and drag the level slider left or right to set the volume level.

If you loaded samples into the sample pool rather than directly to the pads, then let's start assigning them now:

To load a sample directly to a pad, click and drag it from Project panel (in the Samples column) in the lower half of the window onto a pad.

To create a simple drum kit, repeat the above steps for other pads. We recommend loading a kick/bass drum, snare drum, a closed hi-hat, and an open hi-hat.

## Creating a Drum Sequence

Now that your drum kit is set up, let’s record a drum sequence using your MPC hardware.

1. In the MPC software, click the house icon in the upper-left corner to make sure you’re in Main Mode.

2. On your MPC hardware, press Tap Tempo repeatedly at the speed you want to record your sequence. The software will detect the rate and adjust itself automatically.

3. Press the Rec $\left( \nabla \right)$ button to activate Record Mode.

4. Press the Play (D) button to start the actual recording. The pre-count will count one measure before the sequence starts to record. We recommend recording only one sound (pad) at a time, especially if you are not familiar with playing drums on the pads.

5. Play a simple kick/bass drum pattern. The note events you just recorded will automatically be placed in the grid (in this case, on 16th notes). The initial measure length is two bars. After the two bars, the recording will enter Overdub Mode automatically; the sequence plays again from the beginning and keeps looping, allowing you to record further notes. Don't stop the recording!

6. Play the snare drum part, then a hi-hat part.

7. When you’re done recording, press $\mathbf{{Stop}}\left( \blacksquare \right)$ . The Grid Editor in the software will show what you recorded.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_15_594258.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_15_594258.jpg)

If you start recording again on this sequence, keep in mind that the pads you play in your new recording will automatically replace existing notes. To prevent this, you can start again from Step 1 but press Overdub (⊕) instead of Rec (χ9). Overdub lets you record additional note events over the existing sequence.

The Undo button functions differently while in Record Mode. Normally, pressing Undo will undo just the last event. When there is an event to undo, the Undo button will be lit solid. While recording, the Undo button will flash. In this case, pressing Undo will erase all events from that recording (i.e., since Play (D) or Play Start (D) was clicked).

## Renaming & Saving

We recommend renaming your programs and samples before going further.

The collection of drum samples you loaded earlier (and their respective pad assignments) are arranged into a program. When you load this program in the future, you will be able to use all of the samples that belong to it.

Let's rename the existing program as we'll want to create more programs later on.

## To rename a program or track, do one of the following:

<table><thead><tr><th colspan="2">## MIDI</th><th>小 AUDIO</th></tr></thead><tr><td colspan="3">V SEQUENCE 1 Sequence 01</td></tr><tr><td>Bars</td><td>2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>BPM</td><td>120.00</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Loop</td><td></td><td>9</td></tr></table>

VIRACK OF 1 Track 01 Monitor > PROGRAM

- In the "Inspector" on the left edge of the window, double-click the program name or the track name (in the Program or Track field), type a name, and press Enter.

- In the Project panel, under the Programs list, right-click the program, and click Rename. Type a name. Click OK or press Enter to confirm the name, or click Cancel or press Esc to keep the original name.

## To rename your samples:

1. In the Project panel, do one of the following:

- Click All Samples.

- Click a program in the Programs list.

- Click a sequence in the Sequence list or a program under one of those sequences.

2. In the Samples list on the right side of the Project panel, right-click the sample, and click Rename.

3. Type a name (e.g., Kick, Snare, etc.). Click OK or press Enter to confirm the name, or click Cancel or press Esc to keep the original name and press Enter.

Repeat the above steps to rename other samples.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_16_300427.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_16_300427.jpg)

Now would also be a good time to save your project.

To save your project, click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, click File, and click Save Project.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_17_533947.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_17_533947.jpg)

## In the Save Project window, do any of the following:

To select the storage device you want to view, click the down arrow ( $\mathbf{\nabla }$ ) next to the file path. If you have storage devices connected to your MPC hardware, they will appear in this column, as well.

To enter a folder, double-click it or press Enter.

To create a new folder, click New Folder, type a name for the new folder, and then click OK or press Enter to confirm the name, or click Cancel or press Esc to keep the original name. You will immediately enter the new folder.

To move up one folder level, click the up arrow (个).

To name the file, click the File field at the bottom of the window, and type a name.

To save the file, click Save or press Enter.

To save the file as a project template file, click the Save as Template checkbox to select it before clicking Save. This project will then load when you create a new project from a template. (To do this, click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$ in the upper-left corner of the window, select File, and then click New From Template.)

To cancel, click Cancel or press Esc.

In the grid, you can see your recorded notes (or note events) as a sequence.

To enter the Grid Editor, click Grid under the mode icons in the upper-left corner of the window.

## Making Basic Sound Edits

Let's make sure the samples are properly tuned and have good levels.

Click the four-pads icon in the toolbar to enter Program Edit Mode.

Click a pad to show its parameters in the window.

To adjust its volume, click and drag the Level knob in the Pad section up or down.

To adjust its stereo panning, click and drag the Pan knob in the Pad section up or down.

Adjust the level of each pad to suit your taste. We recommend spreading the panning of the bright sounds (e.g., cymbals, snare drum) a little. Additionally, you can tune the bass drum sound-in the Sample Layers section, adjust the Semi and Fine knobs next to the sample name.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_20_108026.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_20_108026.jpg)

The snare drum may need some reverb to give it a more spatial sound.

Click the pad icon in the lower-left corner of the window to show the pad channel strip in the Inspector above it. Press the pad with your snare drum sound to select it.

## To add an effect:

1. In the Inspector, click the arrow $\left( \nabla \right)$ in the desired effect slot. A list of effects will appear.

2. Click the + or - icon to expand or collapse each category of effect.

3. To load an effect, double-click it. Alternatively, click it to select it and then click Select. Let's try Reverb Medium.

To adjust the effect’s parameters, double-click the effect name in the slot.

To empty the effect slot, load an effect but select <none> instead. Switch the effect on or off by clicking the On/Off button for the slot.

## Creating a Bass Track

Let’s try recording a bass line. Unlike a drum kit, it’s important to be able to play and record a bass sound chromatically, so this will be slightly different than setting up the drum kit.

Adding a bass line over the drum part means we need to work on a new track. A $\mathbf{{track}}$ is simply a layer of a sequence. Each track uses a program within your project. You can work with multiple tracks in a single sequence (e.g., a drum track, a bass track, a piano track, etc.). When you play the sequence, all of them will play simultaneously.

Let’s select an empty track, create a program to go with that track, and load a bass sample into that program.

To select a new track, click the Track field in the Inspector, and click Track 2 (unused) in the list of tracks that appears.

Rename the track so we know what it is (e.g., Bass Line).

## To create a new program:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_21_576220.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_21_576220.jpg)

1. In the Inspector, click the piano-keys icon under the Track field. This icon indicates a keygroup program, which is necessary to play the bass sound chromatically with the pads. A name for the new keygroup program will appear in the Program field below.

2. Double-click the new program name, type a name, and press Enter.

## To load and edit a bass sound:

1. Use the File Browser on the right edge of the window to navigate to where your bass sounds are located, and load one to the project's sample pool.

2. After loading a bass sample to the sample pool, don’t click and drag the sample onto a pad like you did when creating a drum program; keygroup programs are different.

Instead, make sure you are in Program Edit Mode: click the four-pads icon in the toolbar.

3. In Program Edit Mode, click the first menu (Layer 1) in the Sample Layers section, and then click your bass sample in the list that appears. Because you're working with a keygroup program instead of a drum program, this sample is now playable across all pads.

Tip: If you click Pad Bank D in the Pads panel and click Pad 13, you should hear the bass sample played back with its original pitch. You can use the other pads to play your sample chromatically.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_21_152010.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_21_152010.jpg)

Let's add a second layer and set the layers' velocity ranges so the bass will sound different when played at a higher velocity (as a real bass would):

1. Use the File Browser to select a different bass sample that sounds similar but a little bit brighter, and load it to the project's sample pool.

2. Return to Program Edit Mode, click the Layer 2 menu in the Sample Layers section, and then select the new bass sample. Click a pad to hear both samples will sound at once. Maybe this new sound is interesting as it is, but let's make some quick edits to get as close as we can to a real-life bass sound.

3. Click and drag the right edge of the Velocity slider for Layer 1 to 80 .

4. Click and drag the left edge of the Velocity slider for Layer 2 to 81.

Now when you press a pad, the lower velocities (0-80) will trigger the Layer 1 sample only, while higher velocities (81-127) will trigger the Layer 2 sample only.

Let's record that bass line now. Prepare your recording as described earlier, and record some bass notes. You can edit your recording just like we've done earlier.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_22_893758.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_22_893758.jpg)

Once you've recorded it, let's tweak the sound a bit in the Filter section:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_23_118238.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_23_118238.jpg)

1. In Program Edit Mode, click the Type menu in the Filter section, and select a filter. Let's try working with Lowpass 4 Pole.

2. Click and drag the Cutoff or Res (resonance) knobs to adjust their settings until your bass sample sounds good to you.

3. Under the Amp Envelope section, click and drag the Attack or Release knobs up or down to adjust their settings. These control the overall level characteristics of the sound.

Let’s add an effect or two to this keygroup program—do this in the same way as you did for a drum program.

So far, we've created a simple drum sequence and a bass line to go with it. Recording an Audio Track

We've already created some MIDI tracks, so let's record some actual audio for our next track:

1. Click the house icon in the toolbar to enter Main Mode.

<table><thead><tr><th>III MIDI</th><th>小 AUDIO</th></tr></thead><tr><td colspan="2">V SEQUENCE 1 Sequence 01</td></tr><tr><td>Bars 2 BPM Loop</td><td>120.00 9</td></tr><tr><td>TRACK 1 Audio 001</td><td>O = 7</td></tr><tr><td>(1) (1) (1) (1) (1)</td><td>INSERTS (4) (4) (1)</td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_24.jpg?x=1103&y=885&w=114&h=74"/></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>AUDIOINPUT Input 1,2 OUTPUT Out 1,2 <img src="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_24.jpg?x=1096&y=1071&w=124&h=333"/> TEL Audio001 <img src="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_24.jpg?x=1116&y=1440&w=109&h=28"/></td><td><img src="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_24.jpg?x=1228&y=1005&w=124&h=399"/> * Outputs 1/2 <img src="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_24.jpg?x=1231&y=1436&w=116&h=42"/></td></tr></table>

2. Click the Audio tab at the top of the Inspector. Audio 001 will appear in the Track field.

3. Connect a synthesizer or other line-level audio source to the $1/4$ " (6.35 mm) input/inputs on your MPC hardware, and set its Line/Phono selector to Line.

Alternatively, connect it to your external audio interface.

4. In the audio track channel strip:

i. Click the input menu (Input $\bot$ ) above, and select Mono > Input 1 or Stereo > Input 1,2 (depending on your audio source) as the input source.

ii. If the output menu (Out __) is not set to Out 1,2, click it and select Output > Out 1,2 as the output.

iii. Click the Monitor (speaker) button to cycle through its three states until it reads Auto (you will hear incoming audio while the track is record-enabled only).

5. On your MPC hardware or external audio interface, turn the Rec Vol knob to set the input level while playing your audio source. You should now see the level in the meter. Make sure it does not exceed the maximum level (the meter should not be "peaking" constantly).

6. In the audio track channel strip, click the Record Arm (0) button next to the pan knob to record-enable the track.

7. In the toolbar at the top of the window, click $\operatorname{Rec}\left( \mathbf{O}\right)$ or $\mathbf{{Overdub}}\left( \oplus \right)$ to record-arm it. Alternatively, click Rec or Overdub on your MPC hardware.

8. To start recording, click the Play (D) or Play Start (D) button in the toolbar (or press Play or Play Start on your MPC hardware)-then play your audio source! You should hear your existing sequence playing in the background.

To stop recording, click the Stop ( $\blacksquare$ ) button in the toolbar (or press Stop on your MPC hardware).

Before creating a song, it would be good to have at least two different sequences, so record another audio track:

1. In the Inspector, click the Sequence field, and click Sequence 2 (unused) in the list of sequences that appears.

2. Click the + icon next to the Track field to add another audio track (Audio 002) to go with that sequence.

## Creating a Song

This section explains how to make a song out of your sequences. Before starting, make sure that you have recorded some sequences.

To enter Song Mode, make sure playback is stopped, click the down arrow ( $\mathbf{\nabla }$ ) next to the other mode icons in the toolbar, and click Song.

In Song Mode, each of the sequences you've created in this project assigned to a pad in the Pads panel. The Sequence List panel is to the left of the pads, showing the song's structure. The upper half of the window will show "blocks" representing each sequence of the song's structure.

As a song plays, it moves through each step shown in the Sequence List panel. Each step contains a sequence you assign in its Sequence menu. Each step can be repeated, determined by the value in the Rpts column (a value of 1 means the sequence will play through only once). The Bars column on the right indicates the length of that sequence.

Each step can be set to play its sequence at an independent tempo, determined by the value in the $\mathbf{{BPM}}$ column.

Important: Each sequence has its own tempo, while the project itself may use a different global tempo. The BPM value for each sequence may be different from the global tempo. As long as playback is set to follow the global tempo, each sequence's individual tempo will be ignored. By default, each project is set to use the sequence tempo, which you set back in the Creating a Drum Sequence chapter. We recommend clicking the Seq/Gbl button at the top of the window (so the button displays GbI) and entering a global tempo to ensure all sequences use the same tempo.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_25_513637.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_25_513637.jpg)

To insert a step at the current position, click Insert Step in the Song Parameters panel. Alternatively, click and drag the pad that corresponds to that sequence into the editor above it.

To delete the currently selected step, click Delete Step in the Song Parameters panel.

To set which sequence plays for a step, click the step’s Sequence menu in the Sequence List panel, and then click the sequence in the menu that appears.

To set how many times a sequence repeats, click and drag the step’s Rpts field (next to the sequence name) up or down.

## Exporting the Song

Want to share your new song? Just export it first.

## To export a song:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_26_862535.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_26_862535.jpg)

1. Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, and go to File $>$ Export and click As Audio Mixdown.

- As you’ll likely share the song online, click the mp3 file format option under File format.

3. Click Export and choose where you want to save the song.

To name the song, click the File field, type a name, and then click Save or press Enter to start exporting.

## Other Features Explained

This chapter describes various advanced features. For fuller explanations of these features, please refer to their corresponding sections in the Operation chapter.

## Step Sequencer

You've already learned how to record note events on a track, but you can quickly enter note events in the Step Sequencer by using the pads as “step buttons,” simulating the experience of a traditional step-sequencer-style drum machine.

To enter the Step Sequencer, do one of the following:

- Click the step-bars icon in the toolbar. If it is not shown, click the down arrow ( $\mathbf{\nabla }$ ), and click Step Sequencer.

- Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, select View $>$ Mode, and click Step Sequencer.

Let's create a sequence on a new track:

1. In the Inspector on the left edge of the window, click the Track field, and then select an (unused) track.

<table><thead><tr><th colspan="4">VITRACK 3 (unused)</th><th>O = A04 All</th></tr><tr><th>出售 Length</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th>Default ✓Custom</th></tr><tr><th></th><th>Seq</th><th></th><th></th><th rowspan="3">✓Type Midi Input Port Midi Input Channel Midi Send Monitor ✓Length Velocity Transpose Mute / Solo</th></tr><tr><th colspan="4">PROGRAM 。 Drums</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2">SEND TO <none></th><th colspan="2">2 4</th></tr></thead></table>

2. If the left-most four-pads icon in the Track section is not selected, click it. This indicates that the track is using a drum program.

3. Click the list icon in the Track section in the Inspector, and click Length so it is selected.

4. Click and drag the Length field in the Track section up or down to set a length for the track. If you select the minimum value, Sequence, the track will be however long your sequence is.

Tip: This lets you maintain tracks of different lengths. For instance, you could play a 1-bar drum sequence repeatedly under a 4-bar bass line.

5. Click the Bar ◂ / ▸ buttons at the top of the Pads panel to select the bar whose steps you want to create or edit. The bar number will appear in the field.

6. Click the pad or sample name in the grid to select the pad whose steps want to create or edit. Alternatively, click and drag the Pad field in the Pads panel up or down; or click Pad Select, click a pad, and then click Pad Select again.

7. Click Play (D) to start your sequence.

8. Each pad represents a step in the bar. If the pad already has note events on the selected track, the corresponding pads (steps) will be lit with colors corresponding to their velocities.

To enter a note at a step, click an unlit pad. The pad will light up with a color corresponding to its velocity.

To delete the note from a step, click a lit pad. The pad will become unlit.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_27_853092.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_27_853092.jpg)

See Operation $>$ Modes $>$ Step Sequencer to learn more about this feature.

## Drum Loops & Chop Mode

Modern music producers often use drum loops to add grit and nuance to programmed beats. This section explains how to use Sample Edit Mode to work with drum loops.

To enter Sample Edit Mode, do one of the following:

- Click the waveform-and-flags icon in the toolbar. If it is not shown, click the down arrow ( $\mathbf{\nabla }$ ), and click Sample Edit.

- Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, select View $>$ Mode, and click Sample Edit.

1. Use the Browser to locate a drum loop, and then double-click it to add it to the project's sample pool. The loop does not have to match the tempo of anything in the project.

2. In the Project panel, click the drum loop you just loaded in the Samples column. If you do not see it, click All Samples in the Project column.

3. In the $\mathbf{Q}$ -Links panel, click $\mathbf{{Chop}}$ to enter Chop Mode, which will let us cut the drum loop into slices.

4. Click the Chop To menu, and then click Threshold.

5. Below that, click the Threshold field and drag it up or down to set a value. The lower the threshold, the more slices will be created. Be sure to select a value so that every transient peak of the drum loop has a corresponding a slice marker.

Tip: Each slice will be automatically assigned to a pad: Pad A01 plays Slice 1, Pad A02 plays Slice 2, etc. Press each pad to play the slice with the same number.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_28_976261.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_28_976261.jpg)

Let's use this chopped sample to create a new program in which each of these slices is an individual sample. We can also automatically create corresponding note events to play back these slices sequentially.

1. In the Extract New Samples section, click New Program.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_29_371908.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_29_371908.jpg)

2. Make sure the Convert To menu is set to New Program with New Samples is selected. If it is not, click it, and select that option.

3. Make sure Crop Samples is selected. If it is not, click it.

4. Make sure Create New Program is selected. If it is not, click it.

5. Make sure Create Events is selected. If it is not, click it.

6. Click and drag the Bars field up or down to select how many bars the entire sample should use in your program.

7. Click Do It to proceed. Each slice will be assigned to a pad, and each pad will have a recorded note event in the track. When you play that track, it will play each pad (each slice) in the original order. Enter Main Mode to see how the sample appears in your sequence.

8. Click Play and listen to how the drum loop matches your sequence's tempo.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_29_492017.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_29_492017.jpg)

You can also edit the note events of the drum loop slices-stay in Main Mode to do this. A new track with the note events playing their corresponding slices has been automatically created.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_30_362230.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_30_362230.jpg)

Use the Time Correct window to quantize the note events so they fall on exact, even time intervals.

To show the Time Correct window, click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, and go to Edit > Time Correct and click Settings.

You can also rearrange the note events, thus creating a new playback order for the slices. You can also edit each slice or sample in Program Edit Mode. You can add effects for slices or use the filter function to change the frequency range of a selected slice. There are limitless possibilities!

See Operation $>$ Modes $>$ Sample Edit Mode $>$ Chop Mode to learn more about this feature.

## Pad Muting & Track Muting

Pad Mute Mode and Track Mute Mode let you silence different pads and tracks to see what the sequence sounds like without those samples or parts.

To enter Pad Mute Mode, do one of the following:

- Click the X-in-square icon in the toolbar. If it is not shown, click the down arrow ( $\mathbf{\nabla }$ ), and click Pad Mute.

- Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, select View $>$ Mode, and click Pad Mute.

1. Press Play to play the sequence.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_31_744491.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_31_744491.jpg)

2. In the Inspector on the left edge of the window, click the Track field, and select a track that uses a drum program.

3. Mute a pad by clicking it. The muted pad will be lit red. You can mute multiple pads at the same time.

See Operation $>$ Modes $>$ Pad Mute Mode to learn more about pad mutes.

You can also mute entire tracks by using the similar Track Mute Mode.

To enter Track Mute Mode, do one of the following:

- Click the bars-and-X icon in the toolbar. If it is not shown, click the $\mathbf{\nabla }$ icon, and click Track Mute.

- Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, select View $>$ Mode, and click Track Mute.

1. Press Play to play the sequence.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_31_100076.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_31_100076.jpg)

2. In the Inspector on the left edge of the window, click the Sequence field, and select the desired sequence.

3. Each pad is assigned to a track. Mute a track by clicking it. The pad will be lit red. You can mute multiple tracks at the same time.

Tip: To mute a track only at precise note intervals ("quantizing" your mutes, essentially), click the Time Correct menu, and click the desired musical value (e.g., 1 bar). Now, when you click a pad in Track Mute Mode, the mute will occur precisely at the beginning of the following time division (in this example, one bar). This lets you test musical combinations of patterns-the preliminary stage to building a song structure.

See Operation $>$ Modes $>$ Track Mute Mode to learn more about track mutes.

## Sampling (Recording)

This section describes recording new samples of your own, which you can use in your projects.

Important: To record any audio, you need to connect an audio source to your MPC hardware or to your computer's audio interface.

## To enter the Sampler, do one of the following:

- Click the vinyl-and-tonearm icon in the toolbar. If it is not shown, click the down arrow ( $\mathbf{\nabla }$ ), and click Sampler.

- Click the menu icon (≡), select View > Mode, and click Sampler.

1. Connect an audio source to the input/inputs of your MPC hardware or computer's audio interface.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_32_996418.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_32_996418.jpg)

2. In the channel strip in the Sampler panel, click the input menu (Input ___), and select the input channels for your audio source.

3. On your MPC hardware or computer's audio interface, set the input level while playing your audio source. You should now see the level in the meter. Make sure it does not exceed the maximum level (the meter should not be "peaking" constantly).

4. Click and drag threshold slider to set the threshold. Set it to a fairly low level (e.g., $- {50}\mathrm{\;{dB}}$ ).

5. Click Arm to record-arm the Sampler.

6. Play your audio source. The Sampler will start recording immediately when the input level reaches the threshold value. Alternatively, click the round Record button or press Enter to manually start recording.

7. To stop recording, click the round Stop button or press Enter. The Keep or Discard Sample window will appear.

## In the Keep or Discard Sample window:

To name the new sample, click the New Name field, type a name, and press Enter.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_32_617667.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_32_617667.jpg)

To assign the new sample to a program, click the Program menu and select the desired program.

To assign the sample to a pad in the program, click and drag the Assign to Pad field up or down, or press the desired pad on your MPC hardware.

To save the recording, click Save.

To play the recording, click Play.

To discard the recording and close the window, click Discard.

To confirm your selections, click Keep.

To edit the recording in Sample Edit Mode, click Edit.

See Operation $>$ Modes $>$ Sampler to learn more about this feature.

## Sample Editing

You may need to edit your newly recorded samples using Sample Edit Mode.

To enter Sample Edit Mode, do one of the following:

- Click the waveform-and-flags icon in the toolbar. If it is not shown, click the down arrow ( $\Psi$ ), and click Sample Edit.

- Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, select View $>$ Mode, and click Sample Edit.

In Sample Edit Mode:

To switch between Trim Mode and Chop Mode, click the Trim, Chop, or Program tab in the Q-Links panel. In this example, use Trim Mode.

To set the sample’s start point, click and drag the green start point marker left or right. You can also use the Q-Link knobs to adjust the start point with varying degrees of resolution. Alternatively, click the value in the Start field in the Parameters panel (in the lower half of the window), type a new value, and press Enter.

To set the sample’s end point, click and drag the red end point marker left or right. You can also use the $\mathbf{Q}$ - Link knobs to adjust the start point with varying degrees of resolution. Alternatively, click the value in the End field in the Parameters panel (in the lower half of the window), type a new value, and press Enter.

To hear your edits, click $\mathbf{{Pad}}$ 10 while in Trim Mode to play the sample from the start point to the end point.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_33_389327.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_33_389327.jpg)

Let's apply some processing to the sample.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_34_306149.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_34_306149.jpg)

To show or hide the Parameters panel, click Parameters below the sample waveform.

1. In the Parameters panel, click Pitch Shift to change the overall pitch of your sample. This will transpose the sample without affecting its length.

2. To set the pitch shift amount, click and drag the Pitch field up or down. Alternatively, click the Pitch field, type a value, and press Enter. To close the window, click Cancel or press Esc.

3. To confirm your selections, click Do It.

To cancel the process, click Cancel or press Esc.

See Operation $>$ Modes $>$ Sample Edit Mode to learn more.

## Recording Automation with Q-Link Knobs

Automating various parameters is a good way to add some motion and dynamism to your sequences.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_35_571130.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_35_571130.jpg)

1. In Main Mode, click a pad that has a sample assigned to it-ideally one that is played multiple times throughout the sequence, so you can hear the automated changes across several notes.

2. In the Q-Links panel, click the Q-Link Mode menu and select Pad Scene. This enables the Q-Link knobs to control various automatable parameters for that pad.

3. On the program channel strip, click the automation button under the Mute (M) button until it shows the red Write (W) option. This ensures your track will record the automation.

4. Record the automation using your MPC hardware:

i. Press Play to start it.

ii. Turn any of these $\mathbf{Q}$ -Link knobs (for example) to record their movement: Q1 (Level), Q2 (Pan), Q12 (Tuning).

iii. Press Stop to finish the automation recording.

5. On the program channel strip, click the automation button under the Mute (M) button until it shows the green Read (R) option. This ensures your track uses the automation you just recorded when you play it back.

Want to see what you've recorded? In the software, to the left of the velocity lane under the grid, click the name of the parameter you automated (Level, Pan, Tuning). The automation curve will appear in the lane. If part of the curve is still not quite what you want, select the pencil tool above the grid and draw in your own automation curve.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_35_724463.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_35_724463.jpg)

See Operation $>$ General Features $>$ Automation to learn more about this.

## Using MPC as a Plugin

If you’re working with other audio software, you can use the MPC software as an instrument plugin (VST, AU, or AAX format) within your host software.

Important: Some of the MPC software's keyboard shortcuts may not work if you are using the MPC software as a plugin (due to those shortcuts being used by your host DAW instead). Go to Help $>$ Software Information and select Keyboard Shortcuts to view a complete list of shortcuts within the MPC software.

Additionally, when using MPC as a plugin on Windows, some fields may not be able to be typed into. The delete shortcut to erase selected notes can still be used by pressing Alt + Del.

Note: To learn how to load and use an instrument plugin in a host application, please refer to the corresponding chapter of your host application's manual.

## Operation

This chapter explains the complete features and functions of the MPC software.

Programs

## About Programs

Each track you create within a sequence uses a program. There are six types of programs, each of which determines how the track sounds or what it is used for. A single project can hold up to 128 programs.

This chapter covers how to create each program type.

To learn about editing your programs to your preference, see the Modes $>$ Program Edit Mode chapter.

A drum program uses one or more samples as its sound source. It contains (1) a list of samples and (2) the

出 settings for each sample (i.e., pad assignments, loop points, pitch tuning, effects, etc.). Drum programs are used mostly for creating drum parts and quickly and easily assigning samples to pads. See Drum Programs for more information.

A keygroup program uses one or more samples as its sound source. It contains (1) a list of samples and (2) the

E settings for each sample (i.e., pitch tuning, effects, etc.). Keygroup programs are used to play samples chromatically with a MIDI keyboard or the MPC pads. See Keygroup Programs for more information.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_36_967734.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_36_967734.jpg)

A plugin program contains an instance of a plugin through which you can send your track’s MIDI data. See Plugin Programs for more information.

A MIDI program lets you send your track's MIDI data to an external MIDI device like a synth or drum 0 machine. See MIDI Programs for more information.

A clip program uses several samples that can be looped (clips). Each clip can be assigned to a pad, which you 回 can press to trigger the clip according to a quantization setting. This lets you create intriguing, layered performances by launching different combinations of clips together. See Clip Programs for more information.

A CV program lets you send your track’s MIDI data to an external MIDI device that uses control voltage (CV),

cv like a synth. Although this option is selectable, it is usable only with MPC hardware that has CV outputs (e.g., MPC X). See CV Programs for more information.

## Drum Programs

A drum program uses one or more samples as its sound source. It contains (1) a list of samples and (2) the settings for each sample (i.e., pad assignments, loop points, pitch tuning, effects, etc.). Drum programs are used mostly for creating drum parts and quickly and easily assigning samples to pads.

## To create a drum program:

1. In the Inspector, click the four-squares icon below the Track field, which indicates a drum program. (Click the $i$ icon to show or hide the Inspector. See Inspector to learn more.)

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_37_446975.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_37_446975.jpg)

2. If the project does not contain a drum program yet, a new drum program (named Program, appended with a number) will be added automatically to the project and appear in the Program field below.

If the project already contains a drum program, the first one will be selected automatically and appear in the Program field below.

To create another drum program, click the + icon above the Program field. A new drum program will be created and appended with a number (e.g., Program 002).

To rename the program, double-click the Program field, type a name, and press Enter.

## To load a sample into a drum program:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_37_472768.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_37_472768.jpg)

1. In the File Browser, find a sample you want to use. (Click the hard-drive icon in the lower-right corner to show or hide the File Browser. See Browser to learn more.)

2. Click and drag the sample from the Browser onto the desired pad. Alternatively, double-click the sample to load it to the sample pool without loading it to a specific pad.

To assign samples to additional pads, repeat Steps 1–2.

Tip: Remember that a drum program has 128 pads total-16 pads across eight banks.

## Alternatively, assign samples in a drum program this way:

1. Click the four-pads icon in the toolbar to enter Program Edit Mode.

2. In the bottom half of the window, scroll to the right to find the Sample Layers section. This lets you view the samples assigned to all four layers of the drum program as well as tuning and level parameters for each layer.

3. Click a pad to select it (and play its assigned samples, if any). The pad will be lit green.

## Keygroup Programs

A keygroup program uses one or more samples as its sound source. It contains (1) a list of samples and (2) the settings for each sample (i.e., pitch tuning, effects, etc.). Keygroup programs are used to play samples chromatically with a MIDI keyboard or the MPC pads.

## To create a keygroup program:

1. In the Inspector on the left edge of the window, click the piano-keys icon below the Track field, which indicates a keygroup program. (Click the $i$ icon to show or hide the Inspector. See Inspector to learn more.)

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_38_716336.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_38_716336.jpg)

2. If the project does not contain a keygroup program yet, a new keygroup program (named Program, appended with a number) will be added automatically to the project and appear in the Program field below.

If the project already contains a keygroup program, the first one will be selected automatically and appear in the Program field below.

To create another keygroup program, click the + icon above the Program field. A new keygroup program will be created and appended with a number (e.g., Program 002).

To rename the program, double-click the Program field, type a name, and press Enter.

## To load a sample for your keygroup program into the project:

1. In the File Browser, find a sample you want to use. (Click the hard-drive icon in the lower-right corner to show or hide the File Browser. See Browser to learn more.)

2. Click and drag the sample from the Browser onto any space outside of the Browser. Alternatively, double-click the sample to load it to the sample pool.

To load additional samples, repeat Steps 1-2.

## To assign samples in a keygroup program:

1. Click the four-pads icon in the toolbar to enter Program Edit Mode.

2. In the bottom half of the window, scroll to the right to find the Sample Layers section. This lets you view the samples assigned to all four layers of the current keygroup as well as tuning and level parameters for each layer.

3. Click a pad to select it (and play its assigned samples, if any). The pad will be lit green.

Tip: In the Pads panel, click the Pad Bank D button to and click Pad 13. You should hear the sample played back with its original pitch. You can use the other pads to play your sample chromatically.

4. Click the menu for a layer, and select a sample.

To create complex keygroup programs, you can add more keygroups (up to 128). This is useful when working with multi-samples (e.g., when programming a real piano).

Tip: Remember that a keygroup program offers up to 128 keygroups, and each keygroup can hold up to four samples (Layers 1-4). This is a total of 512 samples.

## Plugin Programs

A plugin program contains an instance of a plugin through which you can send your track’s MIDI data. This lets you use the same instance of a plugin with multiple tracks (rather than load an instance of a plugin on every track, which can be cumbersome and CPU-intensive). See the Plugins chapter to learn about scanning and selecting plugins.

## To create a plugin program:

1. In the Inspector on the left edge of the window, click the plug icon below the Track field, which indicates a plugin program. (Click the $i$ icon to show or hide the Inspector. See Inspector to learn more.)

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_40_389944.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_40_389944.jpg)

2. If the project does not contain a plugin program yet, a new plugin program (named Plugin, appended with a number) will be added automatically to the project and appear in the Program field below.

If the project already contains a plugin program, the first one will be selected automatically and appear in the Program field below.

To create another plugin program, click the + icon above the Program field. A new plugin program will be created and appended with a number (e.g., Plugin 002).

3. Click the Plugin menu. In the list that appears, click the desired plugin.

To sort your plugins by type or maker, click Sort by type or Sort by manufacturer.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_40_592693.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_40_592693.jpg)

4. Click Select to select the plugin, or click Close to cancel.

Note: You have to specify the disk directory where your plugins are located. This can be done in the software's Preferences. See Preferences to learn more.

5. Next to the Program field, click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$ and click All so it is selected. This will show all settings.

To select the MIDI channel the program will use, click the Input Ch menu, and click the desired channel. Use this setting when you are working with a virtual instrument plugin that supports multi-mode.

To select a preset in your plugin (if any), click the Preset menu, and click the desired preset.

To rename the program, double-click the Program field, type a name, and press Enter.

## To adjust the volume and panning of a track using the plugin program:

1. Click the three-sliders icon in the toolbar to enter the Channel Mixer.

2. In the bottom half of the window, click the channel strip that represents the track with the plugin program to select it. (If you do not see it, make sure the MIDI Tracks button between the grid and channel strips is on.)

3. Click and drag the volume slider or pan knob up or down to adjust it. Important:

If you copy a sequence, the volume and pan values will be copied with that sequence. This is also true if you move to a new sequence and put the same plugin program on a new track.

By default, some plugins do not support MIDI volume and pan. In this case, adjust volume levels and panning on the plugin program channel strip instead of the track channel strip.

## MIDI Programs

A MIDI program lets you send your track’s MIDI data to an external MIDI device like a synth or drum machine.

3. There are five additional settings to configure for a MIDI program: the MIDI Port, program change message (Prog Ch), MIDI channel (Midi Ch), Most Significant Byte (Bank), and Least Significant Byte (Bank LSB). See Modes > Main Mode to learn more.

Next to the Program field, click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$ and click All so it is selected. This will show all settings.

To configure each setting, click its menu, and click the desired option.

Note: You also have to configure the MIDI ports in the software's Preferences. See Preferences to learn more.

To rename the program, double-click the Program field, type a name, and press Enter.

To adjust the volume and panning of a track using the MIDI program:

## MIDI TRACKS

1. Click the three-sliders icon in the toolbar to enter the Channel Mixer.

2. In the bottom half of the window, click the channel strip that represents the track with the MIDI program to select it. (If you do not see it, make sure the MIDI Tracks button between the grid and channel strips is on.)

3. Click and drag the volume slider or pan knob up or down to adjust it.

Important: If you copy a sequence, the volume and pan values will be copied with that sequence. This is also true if you move to a new sequence and put the same MIDI program on a new track.

## Clip Programs

A clip program uses several samples that can be looped (clips). Each clip can be assigned to a pad, which you can click or press to trigger the clip according to a quantization setting. This lets you create intriguing, layered performances by launching different combinations of clips together.

By default, the 16 pads are divided into four columns of four pads. Each column represents a mute group; when a pad is playing a clip, all other pads in that same mute group are turned off. This enables you to launch a clip without having to manually stop other clips that are similar. For instance, pressing Pad 2 may launch a bass clip. You could then press Pad 6, which launches another bass clip and stops the clip on Pad 2. This way, you'll never be playing two bass clips simultaneously.

The four-columns pad configuration described above is just a default to make things easy (e.g., you could use the first column for drum clips, the second for bass clips, the third for keyboard clips, and the fourth for vocal clips.). You can use Program Edit Mode to assign pads to any combination of mute groups you want.

## To create a clip program:

1. In the Inspector on the left edge of the window, click the play-button icon below the Track field, which indicates a clip program. (Click the $i$ icon to show or hide the Inspector. See Inspector to learn more.)

2. If the project does not contain a clip program yet, a new clip program (named Clip, appended with a number) will be added automatically to the project and appear in the Program field below.

If the project already contains a clip program, it will be selected automatically and appear in the Program field below.

To create another clip program, click the + icon above the Program field. A new clip program will be created and appended with a number (e.g., Clip 002).

To rename the program, double-click the Program field, type a name, and press Enter.

## CV Programs

A CV program lets you send your control voltage (CV) signals to an external MIDI device like a synth or drum machine that uses CV.

Important: CV programs are available only while using an MPC model with CV outputs (e.g., MPC X).

## To create a CV program:

1. In the Inspector on the left edge of the window, click the CV icon below the Track field, which indicates a CV program. (Click the $i$ icon to show or hide the Inspector. See Inspector to learn more.)

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_44_640724.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_44_640724.jpg)

2. If the project does not contain a CV program yet, a new CV program (named CV, appended with a number) will be added automatically to the project and appear in the Program field below.

If the project already contains a CV program, it will be selected automatically and appear in the Program field below.

To create another CV program, tap the + icon above the Program field. A new CV program will be created and appended with a number (e.g., CV 002).

3. There are two modes of CV program operation: Melodic and Drum. Click the keys icon to select Melodic operation or click the pads icon to select Drum operation.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_44_508410.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_44_508410.jpg)

There are five additional settings to configure for a Melodic CV program: the $\mathbf{{CV}}$ Port, Gate Port, modulation wheel port (Md.Wheel), velocity port (Vel Port), and note tracking (Note). See Modes > Main Mode to learn more.

For Drum CV programs, click the Edit CV Map button to assign each pad in the program to a specific CV Port and Data Type.

4. Next to the Program field, click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$ and click All so it is selected. This will show all settings.

To configure each setting, click its menu, and click the desired option.

To rename the program, double-click the Program field, type a name, and press Enter.

This chapter describes the available options in the toolbar at the top of the software window.

macOS Users: Five items in this section appear differently on macOS than listed below: Exit/Quit MPC, Preferences, Check for Updates, Expansion Store, and About MPC are located in the MPC menu next to the apple icon (rather than the menus listed below).

Tip: Several selections in the menu can be made by using computer keyboard shortcuts. You can see these keyboard shortcuts next to these selections in the menu. Go to Help $>$ Software Information and select Keyboard Shortcuts to view a complete list of shortcuts within the MPC software. Some of these shortcuts may not work if you are using the MPC software as a plugin (due to those shortcuts being used by your host DAW instead). Additionally, when using MPC as a plugin on Windows, some fields may not be able to be typed into.

## File

- New Project creates an empty project. Use this command when you want to start a project from scratch.

- New From Template loads a user-defined project template. We recommend creating a project with the basic settings that suit your needs and saving it as a project template for easy access. See Preferences $>$ Project Load/Save to learn how to set this template.

- Load Recent provides shortcuts to the last 10 files you have been recently working with. The list is chronological with the most recent file at the top.

- Save Project saves the current project. In the window that appears, name your project and select a save location. The samples in the Project panel will be automatically saved with the project. The project file $\left( \mathbf{{xpj}}\right)$, and its information (samples, MIDI files, program files, etc.) will be saved in a folder with the same name on the same folder level.

- Save Project As is identical to the Save Project function but lets you save the current project with a new name.

- Save All Programs saves all programs of your project.

- Save Current Program saves only the current program (.xpm).

- Save Current Sequence saves only the current sequence (.sxq).

- Save MIDI Control Scene saves your control map as set in MIDI Control Mode („mcn). See Modes > MIDI Control Mode chapter for more information about creating a control map.

- Export lets you export your project or sequence data in various formats: a single project archive file, MPC formats, a standard MIDI file, or as an audio mixdown file. Select the desired option from the sub-menu.

- As Project Archive exports the entire project as a project archive file (.xpa). In the window that appears, type a file name and set the save location. This option is useful when you want to transfer a project between different computers without dealing with its component files.

- As Pattern exports the track (for the current sequence only) as a pattern (.mpcpattern).

10 As MPC1000/MPC2500 Sequence exports the current sequence so it can be read by an MPC1000 or MPC2500 (.seq).

- As MPC1000/MPC2500 Program exports the current program so it can be read by an MPC1000 or MPC2500 (.pgm).

Important: Program samples must be 16 bit in order to work with MPC100/MPC2500. Make sure to convert 24 bit samples to 16 bit prior to exporting the program. The export program process will not convert samples.

10 As MPC5000 Sequence exports the current sequence so it can be read by an MPC5000 (.mid).

o As MPC5000 Program exports the current program so it can be read by an MPC5000 (.50s).

。 $\mathsf{{As}}$ MIDI Sequence $\mathsf{{File}}$ exports the sequence as a standard MIDI file (.mid). In the window that appears, type a file name and set the save location. This option is useful when you want to import your sequences into separate sequencer software or exchange them with another artist.

0 As MIDI Track File exports the track as a standard MIDI file (.mid). In the window that appears, type a file name and set the save location. This option is useful when you want to import your tracks into separate software or exchange them with another artist.

- As Audio Mixdown exports the sequence or song as an audio file. See the Audio Mixdown chapter for more information about this process. If you are in Song Mode, it will affect the entire song. If you are in any other mode, it will affect the current sequence only.

10 As Ableton Live Set exports the current sequence as an Ableton Live Set (.ALS) file. See Addenda > Updates in v2.6 > New Features > Ableton Live Set Export for more information.

- Expansion exports MPC Expansion Packs (installed on your computer) to your MPC X, MPC X SE, MPC Live, MPC Live MKII, MPC One, MPC One+, MPC Key 61, or MPC Key 37 for use in its Standalone Mode. See the Expansions chapter for more information about this process.

- Exit closes the software. (On macOS, this is named Quit MPC and is located in the MPC menu next to the apple icon.) If you have not saved any changes made to a currently open project, it will prompt you to do so before quitting.

## Edit

- Undo undoes the last action you performed. When there are no actions left to undo, this command will be unavailable and appear grayed out.

- Redo undoes the Undo command. You can continue redoing actions until there are no items left to redo, in which case, the Redo command will be unavailable and appear grayed out.

Important: If you perform a new action when the Redo command is available, you will no longer be able to redo In other words, as soon as you perform an editing action other than Undo, Redo is no longer available.

- Undo History lets you view a list of previously executed commands in the Undo History panel. As you undo and redo commands, you can see your current "position" in the list of commands in the window.

Tip: To revert to a previous "state" in your project, click and drag the point just after the last step. Any "undone" steps will be grayed out. You can do the same to redo grayed-out steps, as well.

- Cut removes selected events from the grid and copies it to the clipboard. After cutting events, you can paste or insert them at another location in the same or another sequence.

- Copy copies selected events from the grid to the clipboard without removing them. After copying events, you can paste or insert them at another location in the same or another sequence.

- Paste lets you to paste the contents of the clipboard at the position marker's current location.

- Select All selects all events or audio track regions in the current sequence and track.

- Deselect deselects all events or audio track regions in the current sequence and track.

- Nudge Event Left/Right by TC shifts the selected event/events left or right (respectively) by the time division set in the Time Correct settings.

- Nudge Event Left/Right by Tick shifts the selected event/events left or right (respectively) by one tick.

- Time Correct displays options for using time correct (quantization):

- $\;$ Apply quantizes the currently selected note events. If no note events are selected, nothing will be quantized.

。 $\;$ Settings opens the Time Correct window where you can configure its settings. See the Time Correct chapter for more information about this.

- Humanize applies randomization to the timing, length, and/or velocity of MIDI events. See Addenda $>$ Updates in MPC 2.2 > New Features > Humanize for more information about this.

- Pitch Quantize forces the pitches of note events on a MIDI track into a specific scale. See Addenda $>$ Updates in MPC 2.1 > New Features > Pitch Quantization for more information about this.

- Audio Region provides options related to editing the current audio track region:

- Duplicate copies and pastes the track region immediately after the original one.

- Mute silences the track region.

- Reverse reverses the track region.

- Warp lengthens or shortens the track region without changing its pitch.

Note: The Warp algorithms are very CPU-intensive and can result in audio drop-outs during playback if used too freely. Be mindful of how (and how often) you use the warp function. - Sequence provides options related to editing the current sequence:

- Clear erases all tracks and their note events from the current sequence. After selecting this, click Clear to confirm your choice or Cancel to cancel it. This operation cannot be undone.

- Half Length will immediately halve the length of the sequence (without deleting any note events).

- Double Length will immediately double the sequence and copy all events from the first half to the second half.

- Transpose transposes a range of events on a track in a sequence. See Editing Processes > Sequence for more information.

。 $\;$ Erase erases all or part of a track in a specific sequence. See Editing Processes > Sequence for more information.

- Events Double Speed immediately halves the lengths of all note events on all tracks in the sequence as well as the distance between them. In other words, all tracks' notes are pressed closer together so the sequence sounds like it is playing at twice the previous speed. This does not actually affect the pitches of notes or the tempo.

- Events Half Speed immediately doubles the lengths of all note events on all tracks in the sequence as well as the distance between them. In other words, all tracks' notes are spread further apart so the sequence sounds like it is playing at half of the previous speed. This does not actually affect the pitches of notes or the tempo.

- Next Sequence selects the next sequence. If you select this during playback, the next sequence will be selected when the current one is done playing.

- Previous Sequence selects the previous sequence. If you select this during playback, the previous sequence will be selected when the current one is done playing.

- Next Sequence Now selects the next sequence immediately.

- Previous Sequence Now selects the previous sequence immediately.

- Bounce to Sample immediately renders the sequence (all of its tracks) as an audio sample (.wav) and places it in the project's sample pool. By default, it will be named Bounce - and appended with the sequence name. If you have already used this function on this sequence, then it will create another audio sample appended with the next-highest number.

- Bounce to New Audio Track immediately renders the sequence (all of its tracks) as an audio track (wav) in the project. The Audio tab will be automatically selected. By default, the sample will be named Bounce - and appended with a number. This function does not work for tracks that use MIDI programs or CV programs.

- Track provides options related to editing the current track:

- Delete erases the entire audio track. This cannot be used on MIDI tracks.

- Clear erases all note events from the current track.

- Explode immediately splits the current track into multiple tracks-one for each distinct pad or note (pitch, not event). The current track also remains present and intact, while each track created from it is labeled with the track name and pad name or number.

- Events Double Speed immediately halves the lengths of all note events on the track as well as the distance between them. In other words, the track's notes are pressed closer together so the track sounds like it is playing at twice the previous speed. This does not actually affect the pitches of notes or the tempo.

- Events Half Speed immediately doubles the lengths of all note events on the track as well as the distance between them. In other words, the track's notes are spread further apart so the track sounds like it is playing at half of the previous speed. This does not actually affect the pitches of notes or the tempo.

- Split Events lets you split note events to create new rhythms and patterns. See Addenda $>$ Updates in MPC 2.3 > New Features > Split Events for more information about this.

- Next Track selects the next track.

o Previous Track selects the previous track.

- Bounce to Sample immediately renders the track as an audio sample and places it in the project's sample pool. By default, it will be named Bounce - and appended with the sequence name. If you have already used this function on this sequence, then it will create another audio sample appended with the next-highest number.

- Bounce to New Audio Track immediately renders the track (for the current sequence only) as an audio track in the project. The Main Mode will automatically switch to the Audio tab, and the original track will be muted. By default, it will be named Audio and appended with a number (e.g., Audio 002). This function does not work for tracks that use MIDI programs or CV programs. This cannot be used on audio tracks.

- Program provides options related to editing the current program:

- Pad Color opens the Pad Color window where you can assign specific colors to your pads in each program. See Pad Color for more information.

- Note Mapping opens the Note Mapping window where you can assign a MIDI note to each pad in a program.

- Flatten Pad renders all samples on a pad as an audio sample and places it on the first layer of that pad. See Editing Processes > Program for more information.

- Tidy Keygroup Sample Names automatically renames all samples belonging to a keygroup based on their keygroup, layer, and other information. This option is available only for keygroup programs.

- Duplicate immediately creates an identical program. The duplicate program will use the same name but appended with a number (e.g., Program 002).

- Duplicate to New Track immediately creates an identical program on a new track. The duplicate program will use the same name but appended with a number (e.g., Program 002). The new track will be named Track and appended with a number (e.g., Track 06).

- Merge lets you copy the pads (and their parameters) from one program into another, essentially consolidating two programs into one. See Editing Processes > Sequence for more information.

- Delete erases the program from the project. The samples used in that program will remain in the project's sample pool and any other programs that use them.

- Rename lets you enter a new name for the program. Type a name and click $\mathbf{{OK}}$ to continue or $\mathbf{{Cancel}}$ to return to the previous screen.

- Bounce to Sample immediately renders all tracks that use that program (for the current sequence only) as an audio sample and places it in the project's sample pool. By default, it will be named Bounce - and appended with the program name. This function does not work for MIDI programs or CV programs.

- Bounce to New Audio Track immediately renders that program (for the current sequence only) as an audio track in the project. The Main Mode will automatically switch to the Audio tab. By default, it will be named Audio and appended with a number (e.g., Audio 002). This function does not work for MIDI programs or CV programs.

o Previous Preset and Next Preset select presets when using a plugin program.

- Save Plugin Preset... saves the current preset when using a plugin program.

Start $\left( \left| \mathbf{\lambda }\right| \right)$ to start recording. Recording in this way (as opposed to using Overdub) erases the events of the current sequence. After the sequence plays through once while recording, Overdub (⊕) will be enabled.

---

Click Overdub ( $\oplus$ ) to enable Overdub. When enabled, you can record events in a sequence without overwriting any previously recorded events. You can enable Overdub before or during recording.

Click Retrospective Record to immediately capture recently played MIDI events and add them to the current sequence at the playhead. This is useful for capturing performances when Record was not enabled.

After you record-arm the track and start playback, click Record from Sequence Start to start recording once the sequence loops back to its start. This is essentially a punch-in feature for the entire track, enabling you to start playing a record-armed track while allowing more time than the usual count-in to prepare for the actual recording to start.

Click Punch In to enable or disable the Punch In feature, which enables you to record over a specified length of time in the track. While recording, the entire sequence will play, but you will record over only the area between the Punch In and Punch Out markers, indicated by a red line below the blue timeline. Any part of the sequence before the Punch In marker or after the Punch Out marker will remain untouched, even if you perform over it during recording.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_53_237879.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_53_237879.jpg)

Click Stop ( $\blacksquare$ ) to stop playback. Alternatively, press the space bar. You can double-click this button to silence audio that is still sounding once a note stops playing.

## MIDI Learn Browser

The MIDI Learn Browser lets you assign areas of the MPC software to external MIDI controllers. Global MIDI mappings are helpful if you use certain MIDI controllers across multiple projects. Project MIDI mappings are saved within a project, which can be helpful if your MIDI controller usage is particular to each one. See Addenda $>$ Updates in MPC 2.2 > New Features > MIDI Learn for more information about this.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_68_879877.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_68_879877.jpg)

You can switch the editor between the Grid Editor, Wave Editor, and List Editor, depending on what mode you are in.

To enter each editor, click Grid, Wave, or List below the mode icons. You can do this only when editing MIDI tracks; audio tracks have only the Grid Editor that display the audio track waveform.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_69_370757.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_69_370757.jpg)

In all three editors, these buttons are available in the toolbar:

Click the Stems icon to open the Process Sample - Create Stems window. $J =$ This function will isolate elements of the track and separate them into new stem samples. See Addenda $>$ Updates in MPC 2.14 $>$ New Features $>$ Stems Separation for more information.

Click the magnet icon to switch between the two different modes of "snapping" note events to the grid: Absolute or Relative.

Absolute: Events will "snap" to the nearest time division on the grid (as determined by the TC field or Time Correct window). This is the typical and traditional method of using the snap/quantization feature.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_69_577385.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_69_577385.jpg)

Relative: Events will "snap" to the nearest time division on the grid (as determined by the TC field or Time Correct window) plus the original time position of the event (e.g., an event that is originally three ticks past a time division on the grid will snap only to positions that are three ticks past every time division).

Click the Hitting Pad Selects All Events icon to turn the feature on (red) or off (gray). When on, pressing a pad will automatically select all note events for that pad in the sequence on that track. When off, pressing a pad will simply play its sound without selecting any note events.

Click the left-arrow icon to undo your last action.

Click the right-arrow icon to redo the last action you undid.

Click the Export Audio icon (star-and-waveform) to export the track as an audio file (.wav). Once this is done, the icon will be red. You can then click and drag the icon onto your computer desktop or external storage device to copy it to that location. Press and hold Shift and click the icon to reset it to gray.

---

$\frac{d{\Phi }_{1}}{dt}\left( t\right) = \frac{d{\Phi }_{2}}{dt}\frac{d{\Phi }_{1}}{dt}.$

---

Click the Export MIDI icon (star-and-bars) to export the track as a MIDI sequence. Once this is done, the icon will be red. You can then click and drag the icon onto your computer desktop or external storage device to copy it to that location. Press and hold Shift and click the icon to reset it to gray.

You can use the Record/Export tab in the Preferences to determine precisely what is exported with each of these features. See Preferences to learn about this.

Note: Audio tracks can be exported as 16-bit or 24-bit, ${44.1}\mathrm{{kHz}}$ .wav files, and MIDI tracks are exported as .mid files. These files placed in the [Exports] folder in [your hard drive]\\Documents\\MPC.

## Grid Editor

The Grid Editor has three different appearances: one for drum and clip programs; one for keygroup, plugin, MIDI, and CV programs; and one for audio tracks.

## MIDI

When the MIDI tab in the Inspector is selected, the Grid Editor lets you view and edit the note events of each MIDI track of a sequence and their velocities.

For drum programs, the left column shows you all available pads in a vertical view with their corresponding data.

For keygroup, plugin, MIDI, and CV programs, the left column shows a vertical "piano roll" keyboard.

The Region field shows the name of the currently selected region of the audio track. Double-click it to rename the region.

Click the two-pages-and-+ icon to duplicate the currently selected region of the audio track. The duplicate region will appear immediately after the original one.

Use the Fade In or Fade Out fields to create a fade-in or fade out for the currently selected region of the audio track. The fades will be shown as a sloped line at the start or end of the region.

Use the Level slider to set the level of the currently selected region of the audio track. The waveform amplitude will change accordingly. Alternatively, click the $\mathbf{{dB}}$ value next to the slider and enter the desired level.

Click $\mathbf{M}$ to mute or unmute currently selected region of the audio track.

Click $\star$ Rev to reverse the currently selected region of the audio track.

To lengthen or shorten the currently selected region of the audio track without changing its pitch, click Warp, which will enable the Semi, Fine, and BPM fields next to it. Use the BPM field to change the tempo, which will change the length of the region accordingly. You can also click $\mathrm{X}2$ to double the value or $/2$ to halve it. Use the Semi and Fine fields if you want to change the pitch (this is useful for matching the durations of two samples with different pitches).

Tip: You can configure audio track recording to ensure the resulting track region is warped automatically. You can then adjust the sequence tempo while track region remains in time. See Preferences $>$ General to learn about this.

Note: When you record an audio file, the current sequence tempo will be embedded with it. This information is stored within the sample file when you save the project. When you warp an audio track region, the warping algorithm uses this sequence tempo and the current value in the BPM field to generate the "stretch factor."

Note: The Warp algorithms are very CPU-intensive and can result in audio drop-outs during playback if used too freely. Be mindful of how (and how often) you use the warp function. You can reduce the CPU resources required by doing any/all of the following:

Minimize the amount of pitch adjustment (e.g., the $\mathbf{{Semi}}$ and $\mathbf{{Fine}}$ parameters) of warped audio.

Avoid warping very small track regions.

Warp as few tracks or track regions as possible (i.e., reduce the number of total number of voices of the polyphonic limit that use the Warp algorithm at a given time), especially instances where the warped regions start at the same time.

Avoid rapidly triggering samples that are warped.

If you have warped samples used in a drum program, consider using the Flatten Pad function to consolidate the affected pad's layers into one audio sample (see here to learn about this). After you flatten the pad, its sample/samples no longer need to be warped.

Use a Warp algorithm other than Elastique Pro, which is very CPU-intensive. See Preferences > General to learn how to change this.

Using a higher buffer size (usually above 256) can reduce the possibility of CPU issues. See Preferences $>$ Audio to learn how to do this.

To show or hide the automation lane, click the up or down arrow (^ or v) button next to the horizontal scroll bar under the grid.

## Wave Editor

The Wave Editor lets you view and edit the samples in a project.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_77_993916.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_77_993916.jpg)

The selected pad (e.g., A01, B16, etc.) is shown just below the Grid Editor tab. Click a pad in the Pads panel or press a pad to select it.

Use the Layer menu to select the layer (of the current pad) with the sample you want to view.

## Use the Sample menu to change the sample assigned to the current pad.

Important: The following parameters work in conjunction with Chop Mode (in Sample Edit Mode). Here’s how it works:

When working in Sample Edit Mode and using Chop Mode to divide a sample into slices for your pads, you can convert a slice using Non-Destructive Slice or Pad Parameters.

A Non-Destructive Slice will let its pad to refer to that slice when you press it; the original sample remains intact and each slice marker is like a "bookmark" for a pad. In Program Edit Mode, you'll see that the pad/layer to which it's assigned has its Slice drop-down menu set to the corresponding slice number in the original sample. Playing that pad will cause it to refer to that slice marker like a "bookmark" instead of creating an entirely new sample of that slice. This means that you no longer have to clutter your Project with a new sample for every slice (though you can still use this earlier method, if you prefer).

A slice converted using Pad Parameters is very similar to a non-destructive slice described above. The difference is that in Program Edit Mode, the pads/layers they're assigned to have their Slice drop-down menus set to Pad (instead of the slice number), and the Pad Start and Pad End points will correspond to the slice markers in the original sample.

See Modes > Sample Edit Mode > Chop Mode to learn more about this.

Use the Start field to determine the position (in samples) where the pad’s playback will start. The minimum value is 0 , and the maximum value is the End value.

Note: When Loop Lock is on, the loop position (as determined in the Loop field) is the same as the pad start. When off, the loop position is independent from the pad start.

Use the End field to determine the position (in samples) where the pad’s playback will stop. The minimum value is the Start value, and the maximum value is the sample's total length (in samples).

Use the Loop menu to select the Pad Loop mode.

Important: For Pad Loop to work, you must (1) set the Sample Play field to Note On in the Pad Play Modes section of Program Edit Mode (see Modes > Program Edit Mode) and (2) set the Slice field to Pad.

Off: The sample will not loop.

Fwd: You can hold down the pad to cause that sample to repeat from the Loop position to the end of the sample. Release the pad to stop the repeating playback.

Rev: You can hold down the pad to cause that sample to play in reverse, repeating from the end of the sample to the Loop position. Release the pad to stop the repeating playback.

Alt: You can hold down the pad to cause that sample to play from the Loop position to the end of the sample and then play in reverse until it reaches the Loop position again. This will repeat as long as you are holding the pad down. Release the pad to stop the repeating playback.

Click the lock icon to turn Loop Lock on or off. When on, the lock icon will be red and the Loop field will be disabled.

<table><thead><tr><th>Loop</th><th>1702</th><th>Off</th></tr></thead><tr><td>Loop</td><td>1702</td><td>Off</td></tr></table>

Use the Slice field to select what part/parts of the sample will play:

All: The entire sample will play.

Pad: The sample will play from the $\mathbf{{Start}}$ position to the $\mathbf{{End}}$ position. This also lets you activate Pad Loop.

Slice 1, 2, 3, etc.: If you have sliced the sample in Chop Mode, you can select which slice will play when you trigger the pad.

Click Rev to reverse the sample's playback.

Use the Tail Length and Tail Start fields to add extra tail to the end of a sample.

Tail Length: Sets the overall length of time the tail is active.

Tail Start: Sets the point at which the tail starts looping.

Use the X-Fade field to add real-time crossfade looping to sample playback.

Use the $\mathbf{X}$ - $\mathbf{{Fade}}$ field to set the length of the crossfade in samples.

Click the icons next to the X-Fade field to select a Linear (straight lines) or Equal Power (curved lines) crossfade.

Use the Offset field to determine a time offset for the sample’s playback.

Positive values: When the pad is played, playback will start immediately but at a later point in the sample specified by the offset value.

Negative values: When the pad is played, playback will be delayed by the amount specified by the offset value.

Use the Semi field to adjust the tuning of the sample. The sample’s detected $\mathbf{{Key}}$ will be shown to the right and will change based on how the sample is tuned.

Click Warp to lengthen or shorten the sample (based on the BPM) without changing its pitch.

Use the Stretch field to set the "stretch factor," which affects how the sample is warped (if Warp is on).

Use the BPM field to enter a tempo, which affects how the sample is warped (if Warp is on). You can also click $\mathbf{{X2}}$ to double the value or $/2$ to halve it.

Click the circular-arrows icon to enable or disable BPM Sync. When BPM Sync and Warp are both enabled, the sample's BPM will be "locked" to the tempo of the sequence. When BPM Sync is disabled but Warp is enabled, the sample will be independent of the tempo of your sequence—use the $\mathbf{{Stretch}}$ field to lengthen or shorten a sample.

Tip: You can configure audio track recording to ensure the resulting track region is warped automatically. You can then adjust the sequence tempo while track region remains in time. See Preferences $>$ General to learn about this.

Note: When you record an audio file, the current sequence tempo will be embedded with it. This information is stored within the sample file when you save the project. When you warp an audio track region, the warping algorithm uses this sequence tempo and the current value in the BPM field to generate the "stretch factor."

Note: The Warp algorithms are very CPU-intensive and can result in audio drop-outs during playback if used too freely. Be mindful of how (and how often) you use the warp function. You can reduce the CPU resources required by doing any/all of the following:

Avoid using extreme Stretch values, especially anything below 100.

Minimize the amount of pitch adjustment (e.g., the $\mathbf{{Semi}}$ and $\mathbf{{Fine}}$ parameters) of warped audio.

Avoid warping very small track regions.

Warp as few tracks or track regions as possible (i.e., reduce the number of total number of voices of the polyphonic limit that use the Warp algorithm at a given time), especially instances where the warped regions start at the same time.

Avoid rapidly triggering samples that are warped.

If you have warped samples used in a drum program, consider using the Flatten Pad function to consolidate the affected pad's layers into one audio sample (see here to learn about this). After you flatten the pad, its sample/samples no longer need to be warped.

Use a Warp algorithm other than Elastique Pro, which is very CPU-intensive. See Preferences $>$ General to learn how to change this.

Using a higher buffer size (usually above 256) can reduce the possibility of CPU issues. See Preferences $>$ Audio to learn how to do this. Click the gear icon to enable or disable Link Slices and Zero Snap, to select an editing process (Process Sample), to set the Slice Preview behavior:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_80_174199.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_80_174199.jpg)

Link Slices: When Link Slices is set to On, changing the start point of a slice (after you have created slices of a sample in Chop Mode) will also change the end point of the previous slice. Similarly, changing the end point of a slice will also change the start point of the next slice. When set to Off, you can create slices that are nonsequential, noncontiguous, or overlapping. This is the same as clicking the Link Slices button in the Q-Links panel in Sample Edit Mode.

Process Sample: Select an editing process to apply to the sample. These are the same processes available in Sample Edit Mode while in Program Mode (see Modes > Sample Edit Mode > Program Mode to learn more).

Slice Preview: This determines if/how audio is played as you move a slice marker. As you move the slice marker through a sample waveform, you can set it to play the small part of the sample before the slice marker (Before), play the small part of the sample after the slice marker (After), or not play at all (Off). You can also configure this setting in the Preferences (see Preferences > General).

Zero Snap: Enable Zero Snap to force start points, end points, and loop points to occur only at the waveform's "zero-crossings." This can help to avoid clicks and glitches when playing a sample. This is the same as clicking the Zero Snap button in the Q-Links panel in Sample Edit Mode.

The large waveform display shows the “active” section of the sample waveform. The strip above the large display shows an overview of the entire sample waveform. If the waveform display is showing only part of the entire sample waveform, a white box in the overview will indicate the current position.

The timeline provides a reference for the length of the sample. Click the down arrow $\left( \nabla \right)$ or right-click anywhere on the timeline to select the increments it will use: Time (secs:ms), Samples, or Beats.

Scroll left or right on the waveform to move through it. Use the sliders in the lower-right corner or click the timeline and drag down or up to zoom in or out.

The green marker and red marker are the start point and end point (respectively). These two points define the region of the sample that will be played.

## Mixer Window

If you want to see channel strips for both the Pad Mixer and the Channel Mixer at the same time, you can open the Mixer Window, which provides an overview of the channel strips in both modes in one screen.

To open or close the mixer window, do one of the following:

- Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, and go to View and click Show Mixer Window.

- Click the two-sliders icon in the lower-left corner of the window.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_87_894102.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_87_894102.jpg)

The upper half of this window shows the Pad Mixer channel strips (see Modes $>$ Pad Mixer to learn about these). The lower half of the window shows the Channel Mixer channel strips (see Modes > Channel Mixer to learn about these). All selectors and channel strips work as they normally do in their respective modes.

Tip: This window can be very helpful when using a dual-monitor computer setup.

Use the three icons at the top of the window to select which channel strips are shown: 早丰园建

Click the pad-and-slider icon to show just the Pad Mixer channel strips.

Click the two-sliders icon to show just the Channel Mixer channel strips.

Click the pad-and-three-sliders icon to show both Pad Mixer and Channel Mixer channel strips.

In several modes, the lower half of the window shows several different panels.

## To show or hide each panel, click its selector.

To show or hide the entire bottom panel, click the two-panels icon in the lower-left corner of the window.

This chapter describes the available panels.

Note: Similar to these panels, the lower half of the window of the Pad Mixer and Channel Mixer shows several different channel strips, which you can show or hide by clicking the selectors. See Modes > Pad Mixer and Modes > Channel Mixer chapter to learn about these.

## MIDI Keyboard

The MIDI keyboard feature is a graphical representation of a piano keyboard at the bottom of the window.

To show or hide the MIDI keyboard, do one of the following:

- Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, and go to View and click Show MIDI Keyboard.

- Click the two-panels icon in the lower-left corner of the window.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_88_619605.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_88_619605.jpg)

Whenever a note is played (by pressing a pad, playing the current sequence, etc.), the corresponding keys on the MIDI keyboard will be lit, appearing to be "played." These keys will correspond to the notes played in the current track only.

Similarly, you can click keys on the MIDI keyboard to trigger those notes on the current track. This can be useful for auditioning the sound of the track's program in different octaves.

Click the left-arrow or right-arrow button on either side of the MIDI keyboard to shift the range of the keys displayed in the window.

If the MIDI Keys feature is enabled, the corresponding computer keyboard character will be shown above each key, though you can still use MIDI keys even if it is hidden. Furthermore, you can use the MIDI keyboard even if MIDI Keys is disabled. See Toolbar $>$ Menu $>$ Tools to learn about this feature.

## Q-Links

The Q-Links panel shows the 16 Q-Link knobs with their assigned parameters listed below.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_89_348013.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_89_348013.jpg)

Click the Q-Link Mode menu to select the current edit mode of the Q-Link knobs:

Project: In this edit mode, the Q-Link knobs can control 16 parameters within the current project overall. See the following Project section to learn how to use this mode.

Program: In this edit mode, the Q-Link knobs can control 16 program or audio track parameters. See the following Program section to learn how to use this mode.

Pad Scene (for drum programs only): In this edit mode, the Q-Link knobs can control 16 parameters for the currently selected pad. See the following Pad Scene section to learn how to use this mode.

Pad Parameters: In this edit mode, the 16 Q-Link knobs correspond to the 16 pads, each one controlling the same parameter for each pad. This is useful if you need to adjust the same parameter on multiple pads at once rather than having to select and edit each pad individually. See the following Pad Parameters section to learn how to use this mode.

Screen: In this edit mode, the Q-Link knobs will control a default parameter or group of parameters in your currently selected mode (e.g., Main Mode, Sample Edit Mode, etc.).

Note: When using MPC hardware with four Q-Link knobs (e.g., MPC Live, MPC Touch, etc.), a gold rectangle in this panel indicates the four knobs that can be controlled by that bank of four Q-Link knobs.

While in any Q-Link Mode other than Screen Mode, click the Learn button to turn Learn Mode on or off. When on, adjusting a control in the MPC software window will immediately assign it to the currently selected Q-Link knob.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_89_312006.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_89_312006.jpg)

To assign a function to a Q-Link knob in Learn Mode:

1. Click Learn so the button is lit. (This will stop playback. Resuming playback will exit Learn Mode.)

2. Click the desired $\mathbf{Q}$ -Link knob.

## Preferences

The Preferences window contains many customizable elements of the software. Click the corresponding tab on the left to select it (e.g., MIDI, Sequencer, etc.). Click the OK button to close the Preferences window. Changes to the Preferences are saved automatically except for Vintage Mode (in the General tab) and Start Time (in the MIDI / Sync tab).

To open the Preferences:

Windows: Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, select Edit, and click Preferences.

macOS: Click the MPC menu, and click Preferences.

## Audio

Audio Device Type and Device or Output & Input: Click these drop-down menus to select an audio hardware driver in your computer system.

Test: Click this button to play a test tone. This is for checking your audio output. Careful! You should lower the volume on your audio system beforehand.

Sample Rate: Click this to drop-down menu to select the desired sample rate for your project. This depends on the available sample rates of the type of MPC hardware you are using or of your audio interface (i.e., select 96000 Hz only if your interface allows a ${96}\mathrm{{kHz}}$ sample rate).

Audio Buffer Size: Click this drop-down menu to set your audio system’s latency. Lower values result in a more immediate playing response but also more CPU consumption. If you are working with larger projects, this may cause audible clicks and pops. Higher values are more CPU-friendly but can produce more delay between pressing a pad and hearing the corresponding sound. The ideal audio buffer size also depends on your computer's CPU performance. Experiment with this to find the best setting for your system.

Latency Adjust: This indicates the amount of latency (delay) in your audio system.

## MIDI / Sync

The settings on this screen determine how the MPC software sends, receives and synchronizes with connected USB and MIDI devices.

Input Ports: This indicates the available installed MIDI Input ports on your computer system and any connected devices. Next to each port are three options:

Global: Enable this option to always send incoming MIDI data from this port to the current track.

Control: Enable this option to send incoming MIDI data from this port to MIDI Learn.

Track: Enable this option for this MIDI port to appear in the list of available track MIDI inputs.

Output Ports: This indicates the available MIDI Output ports. Next to each port are two options:

Sync: Enable this option to send MIDI Clock or MTC information over this output port, based on the Sync

Output setting.

Track: Enable this option for this MIDI port to appear in the list of available track MIDI outputs.

Note: When using the MPC software as a plugin, the only option you can select for your Midi Output Port is your host software (DAW).

Click the reset arrow to reset the MDI Input/Output Port settings. Double-click the port name to rename it.

Enable MIDI ports when discovered: When enabled, the Track ports are automatically turned on when a MIDI device is plugged in so it can immediately be selected as an input or output.

MIDI Machine Control (MMC) Receive: When enabled, the MPC software will be able to receive MIDI Machine Control (MMC) information. When disabled, the MPC software will not receive this information.

Ableton Start/Stop Sync: When enabled, the MPC software will sync with Ableton Link to synchronize the beat, phase and tempo of Ableton Live and Ableton Link-enabled applications over a wireless or wired network.

Sync Receive: This determines whether the MPC software receives MIDI Clock information (MIDI Clock), MIDI Time Code information (MIDI Time Code (MTC)), communication from Ableton Link, or no synchronization information (Off).

Important: Audio recording is disabled when receiving MIDI Clock sync. Use MIDI Time Code to record audio while receiving MIDI sync.

MIDI Machine Control (MMC) Send: When enabled, the MPC software will be able to send MIDI Machine Control (MMC) information. When disabled, the MPC software will not send this information.

Sync Output: This determines whether the MPC software sends MIDI Clock information (MIDI Clock), MIDI Time Code information (MIDI Time Code (MTC)), or neither (Off).

MTC Frame Rate: This determines the frame rate used by MIDI Time Code (MTC), which is important for correct timing, especially when working on film scoring projects: 24, 25, 30 drop, or 30 non-drop. In most cases, you should select 25 .

Start Time: This is the starting time that will be sent when Sync Output is set to anything other than Off. The time is formatted in hours:minutes:seconds:frames.

Filter ‘All Notes Off’ CC: When enabled, “All Notes Off” (“MIDI panic”) messages will be ignored. This is useful if you are using an external MIDI device that can send these types of messages but you want to filter them out. When disabled, "All Notes Off" messages will be received normally.

Program Change: This determines what an incoming MIDI program change message will change: a Program, Sequence, or Track.

## Plugins

Here you can select up to four locations on your hard disk where the software will look for installed VST or AU plugins that you can use in the MPC software.

Click the $\ldots$ button to the right of the field to select a desired location. After selecting a new location, we recommend using the Scan New function. When you configure these Plugin tab settings for the first time, you should click Rescan All to perform a complete scan of all selected plugin locations.

See the Plugins chapter to learn about managing your plugins once they are scanned.

## Sequencer

The settings on this screen determine how sequencing works in Grid Editor and in the Step Sequencer.

Instant Track Mute: When disabled, if you mute a track, its Note On messages will be ignored, and samples and notes that are playing will finish playing their entire length (this is how legacy MPCs' track-muting worked). This is useful if you are using loops and want a loop to play to the end of a bar but not play the next time the sequence loops. When enabled, if you mute a track, the MIDI track volume (0) will be sent. The loop will continue to play but at zero volume, allowing the loop to continue playing when the track is unmuted. This is useful when you want to have the track muted immediately.

Play Track Mute and Solo Events: When enabled, track mute and solo events are played back when you are in Track Mute Mode. When disabled, track mute and solo events will not be played back while in Track Mute Mode.

Rec Arm: This determines the behavior of the Record Arm buttons. When set to Single, selecting a different track will automatically arm that track and disarm all other tracks. This is the default mode and it is the same as previous MPC releases. When set to Multi, you can tap any track's record button to add it to the group of armed tracks.

Record Track Mute and Solo Events: When enabled, track mute and solo events are recorded when you are in Track Mute Mode (timing correct settings will affect the recorded position events). When disabled, track mute and solo events will not be recorded while in Track Mute Mode. This feature is useful if you want to use Track Mute Mode to record track mutes or solos into your sequences as opposed to using Track Mute Mode for performance or listening purposes only.

Record Pad Aftertouch Events: When enabled, pad aftertouch data (from your MPC hardware's pressure-sensitive pads) will be recorded. When disabled, pad aftertouch data will be ignored.

Place Events Recorded During Count-In at Start Point: When enabled, pressing a pad during the recording’s pre-count will record that note event at the start of the recording (this is how the MPC3000 worked). When disabled, no notes will be recorded until the pre-count is finished and recording has begun.

Note: This setting is ignored when recording with the Arpeggiator active.

Truncate Duration: This determines if/how events are cropped if they exceed the length of the current Sequence:

To Sequence Length: If the length of an event exceeds the length of the sequence, it will be truncated. This ensures that the event will not overlap itself when the sequence loops.

To Sequence End: If an event exceeds the length of the sequence, it will be truncated to the end of the current sequence. In other words, the event will stop playing when the sequence ends or loops.

As Played: Events will play back exactly as they were recorded, even if they overlap themselves when the sequence loops.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_97_459808.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_97_459808.jpg)

For example, if you record a note starting on the second bar of a 4-bar loop and hold it for 5 bars, the note would end: at bar 7 (As Played), at bar 6 (To Sequence Length), or bar 4 (To Sequence End). See image for details.

Q-Link Swing Control Applies TC Settings On Release: When this box is selected, moving the Swing parameter assigned to a Q-Link knob will apply the timing correct settings (including the new Swing value) when you release the knob.

Display Resolution: This is the display resolution (in PPQN-pulses per quarter note) of pulse values in certain areas of the operating system. Please note that this setting affects the display resolution, not the timing.

## Hardware

The settings on this screen determine the behavior of your MPC hardware’s pads as well as connected footswitches.

Pad Threshold: This determines how much force is required to strike the pads for them to trigger.

Pad Sensitivity: This determines how the pads respond to touch. At lower values, you need to use more force to generate a high-velocity note. At higher values, it is easier to generate high-velocity notes, even if you do not use much force while pressing a pad.

Pad Curve: This determines how striking the pads translates into velocity values. The A curve is essentially linear, while the $\mathbf{B},\mathbf{C}$, and $\mathbf{D}$ curves are exponential.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_98_560831.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_98_560831.jpg)

Pad Response (Velocity & Aftertouch): View these meters when striking and pressing the pads to help gauge the force and pressure you are applying to them. These meters are useful when adjusting the Pad Threshold and Pad Sensitivity parameters (above).

Footswitch 1 & Footswitch 2: These determine how footswitches connected to your MPC hardware will work. You can select either transport commands (e.g., Play or Stop) or trigger commands for pads and other buttons.

Display: This determines how the display functions for a connected MPC Touch.

Screen Dimming: This determines how much time must pass before your MPC hardware automatically dims its touchscreen (if it uses a battery, this can help preserve battery life).

VU Meter Source (only when using MPC X/MPC X SE in Controller Mode): This determines what audio signal level is shown in the level meters (on the right side of the screen). When set to Main, the level meters show the audio signal sent out of Outputs 1/2 (the Main L/R outputs on the rear panel). When set to Current Program, the level meters show the audio signal of the currently selected program (i.e., the program used by the currently selected track and any other tracks that also use it).

Show Hardware Info: Click this button to open a window with information about your connected MPC hardware (firmware version, driver version, etc.).

Tap Tempo: This determines how many times you have to press the Tap Tempo button before the new tempo is recognized.

Flash Tap Tempo Light: When enabled, the Tap Tempo button’s light will flash in time with the tempo. When disabled, the Tap Tempo button's light will be off.

Bank Button Press: This determines how the Pad Bank buttons work.

Select A-D: Pressing a Pad Bank button once will select the corresponding bank from Pad Banks A-D. Pressing and holding Shift while pressing a Pad Bank button will select the corresponding bank from Pad Banks E-H.

Select/toggle bank: Pressing a Pad Bank button will alternate between the corresponding bank from Pad Bank A-D and Pad Bank E-H. In other words, you do not need to hold Shift to select one of Pad Banks E-H.

Shift + Q-Link Press: This determines the behavior of pressing Shift and the Q-Link button (if applicable) on your MPC hardware. Select Q-Link Edit to open the Q-Link Edit window, or Cycle Backwards to move backwards between the four Q-Link banks.

Global Pitch Bend: When enabled, this will override the pitch bend settings of all programs, so that those with pitch bend disabled or set to different ranges will only use the Global Range instead. When disabled, all programs may use their individual pitch bend settings.

Range Down and Range Up: These determine the maximum shift of semitones up or down that will be applied when pitch bend is used.

## Project Defaults

The settings on this screen determine various default values for any new project that you create.

Default Tempo: This is the default tempo in BPM.

Default Global Tempo: When set to On, the default tempo value will be used for the global tempo. When set to Off, the default tempo will be used for sequences.

Default Sequence Bars: This determines the default number of bars of a new sequence.

Default Time Signature (Numerator/Denominator): This determines the default time signature of a new sequence. The numerator is the number of beats per bar, while the denominator is the value of each beat.

Default Pad Slice: This determines how new samples will play when you load them or record them into a project. When set to Pad, the Slice menu in Program Edit Mode will be set to Pad, which lets you set the start point, end point, etc. for the layer. When set to All, the Slice menu in Program Edit Mode will be set to All, in which the entire sample plays.

Default Drum/Keygroup Filter: This determines the default type of filter that drum and keygroup programs will use. See Appendix $>$ Glossary $>$ Filter to learn about this.

Default Plugin Synth: This determines the default instrument plugin that a new plugin program will use. Use the window that appears to select it. See Plugins $>$ Selecting Plugins to learn about this.

Show New Project Dialog: This determines whether the MPC demo screen appears when the MPC software is started. Select Off to disable the demo screen, or select Demo/Template/Recent to enable it.

## Project Load/Save

The settings on this screen determine if (and how) projects are automatically saved.

Auto Load File: Click the ... button to select a project (.xpj) or program (.xpm) on your hard disk to load automatically anytime the software opens.

Tip: To "bypass" or ignore the auto load file, press and hold Shift while opening the MPC software. This will open an empty project instead of your selected Auto Load file.

Enabled: When enabled, the MPC software will automatically save your current project after each Timeout interval. When disabled, the MPC software will not automatically save your project; you must save your project manually.

Timeout: Use this field to select how often your project will automatically save.

Template File: Click the … button to select a project to load when you create a new project from a template. To do this, click the menu icon (=) in the upper-left corner of the window, select File, and then click New From Template.

## Record/Export

The settings on this screen determine the parameters for recording and exporting.

Recording Bit Depth: This determines bit depth of the audio recorded from a sample.

Include Program Volume/Pan Settings: When enabled, the exported audio or MIDI file will include its volume and pan settings. When disabled, the volume and pan settings will be set to $\mathbf{0}\mathbf{{dB}}$ and center (C), respectively.

Bypass Program Effects Plugins: When enabled, the exported audio or MIDI file will include any third-party effect plugins that are used with it, but those effects will be bypassed (deactivated). When disabled, those effects will be activated.

Audio Tail Length: This determines the length of an audio tail (silence) that will be applied to the exported audio file. When set to $\mathbf{0}$, the audio file will not have any additional audio tail.

Audio Export: This determines what part of the sequence is exported when you click the Export Audio icon.

Track: When this is selected, Export Audio will export the currently shown track in the current sequence.

Program: When this is selected, Export Audio will export all tracks in that sequence that use the currently shown program.

Main: When this is selected, Export Audio will export all tracks in that sequence that use programs routed to the main outputs.

MIDI Export: This determines what part of the sequence is exported when you click the Export MIDI icon.

Track: When this is selected, $\operatorname{\mathbf{E} \mathbf{x} \mathbf{p} \mathbf{o} \mathbf{r} \mathbf{t} }$ MIDI will export the currently shown track in the current sequence.

Sequence: When this is selected, Export MIDI will export all tracks in the current sequence.

Bounce Bit Depth: This determines bit depth of the audio file that is exported when you click the Export Audio icon: 16-bit or 24-bit.

## General

The settings on this screen determine how other features work in the hardware and operating system.

Vintage Mode: This determines the type of emulation applied to the audio output. You can apply the particular sonic qualities of, for example, the MPC3000 or MPC60, or of course no emulation (None).

Audition Auto Play: This determines how long a sample will sound when auto-previewing it.

Audition Outputs: This determines which pair of outputs will play any auditioned sounds: Out 1,2-31,32. These sounds include: samples, programs, and projects in the Browser; sample playback, Cue Preview, and Slice Preview in Sample Edit Mode; and sample playback in the $\mathsf{{Keep}}$ or Discard Sample window in the Sampler.

Cue Preview: This determines if/how audio is played as you move the cue playhead. As you move the cue playhead through a sample waveform, you can set it to play the small part of the sample before the cue playhead (Before), play the small part of the sample after the cue playhead (After), or not play at all (Off).

Slice Preview: This determines if/how audio is played as you move a slice marker. As you move the slice marker through a sample waveform, you can set it to play the small part of the sample before the slice marker (Before), play the small part of the sample after the slice marker (After), or not play at all (Off). You can also configure this setting in the Wave Editor (see Editors $>$ Wave Editor).

Audio Warp Algorithm: This determines how a sample is "warped" when you adjust the length of a sample without changing its pitch (e.g., the Warp function in Audio Edit Mode for audio tracks or in Program Edit Mode for clip programs).

Note: The Warp algorithms are very CPU-intensive and can result in audio drop-outs during playback if used too freely. Be mindful of how (and how often) you use the warp function. You can reduce the CPU resources required by using a Warp algorithm other than Elastique Pro, which is very CPU-intensive.

Audio Tracks Auto Warp: This determines how recorded audio track regions are warped. When set to On, any audio track region that you record will be warped automatically to match the current sequence tempo. You can then adjust the sequence tempo while the audio track region remains in time.

Note: When you record an audio file, the current sequence tempo will be embedded with it. This information is stored within the sample file when you save the project. When you warp an audio track region, the warping algorithm uses this sequence tempo and the current value in the BPM field to generate the "stretch factor."

BPM Detection Range: This defines the range of detectable BPM values when you use any automatic BPM detection function in the software or when you press the Tap Tempo button to enter a new tempo.

Show Mode Shortcut Panel: When enabled, you can use the mode shortcut panel on your MPC touchscreen hardware. To use this, swipe the black touch handle to the right from the left edge of the touchscreen while viewing any mode. The five modes from the left-most column of the Menu can be accessed here.

Allow Multiple Plugin Windows: This determines whether multiple plugin windows can be displayed at the same time (a feature added to MPC 2.1) or only one plugin window can be displayed at a time (how plugin windows worked prior to MPC 2.1).

Desktop Screensaver Disable: This determines if/when your computer's screensaver is disabled while using the MPC software (using your MPC hardware in Controller Mode):

Never: Your computer's screensaver will function normally.

When hardware used: As long as your MPC hardware is connected to your computer and being used, your computer's screensaver will be disabled.

When hardware attached: As long as your MPC hardware is connected to your computer and powered on, your computer's screensaver will be disabled. It will function normally again if you power off or disconnect your MPC hardware from your computer.

Always: Your computer's screensaver will be disabled as long as the MPC software is open (whether or not your MPC hardware is connected or powered on).

Q-Link Playhead Increment: This determines whether turning Q-Link Knob 2 (Playhead) in Main Mode will move the playhead location by $1/{16}$ th-note increments (1/16 Note) or according to the time division (TC Division).

Collect Usage Statistics: This determines whether or not your usage statistics will be sent occasionally to us, enabling us to improve the MPC experience.

Multi Process Threads: This determines how many cores of your computer's processor will be used to render audio. The available range depends on your processor.

## Time Correct

The Timing Correct window contains various settings to help quantize events in your sequence. You can quantize note events on MIDI tracks or track regions on audio tracks (though you cannot apply all types of quantization to audio tracks).

Timing Correct

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_102_849453.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_102_849453.jpg)

To open the Timing Correct settings, click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$ , select Edit, select Time Correct, and click Settings....

To enable or disable Global Timing Correct, click the Global Tming Correct button.

To apply the settings you selected to all tracks, click All Tracks.

To apply the settings you selected to the current track, click Do It.

To cancel and return to the previous screen, click Close.

## Use the Type selector to set how timing corrections are applied.

Start: The entire note event or audio track region will be nudged forward or backward so the start point aligns with the closest time division marker in the grid. You can apply this to MIDI tracks or audio tracks.

End: The end points of note events will be extended or shortened to align with the closest time division marker in the grid. The start points will remain untouched. You can apply this to MIDI tracks only.

Length: The end points of note events will be extended or shortened so that each event’s length is a multiple of the time division, regardless of where it is in the grid. The start points will remain untouched. You can apply this to MIDI tracks only.

Legato: The end points of note events will be extended or shortened to create a long, unbroken phrase from the first note event's start point to the last note event's end point. Each note event will sustain until another note event starts. If multiple note events start at the same time (and are not the last note events), their lengths will become identical. Selecting Legato disables all other options in this window. You can apply this to MIDI tracks only.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_102_598681.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_102_598681.jpg)

Use the Time Division selector to set the quantization value. Events will “snap” to these time divisions on the grid. The $\mathbf{T}$ indicates a triplet-based value.

Alternatively, click the TC field at the top of the window and select a time division.

Use the $\mathbf{S}$ wing field to set the amount of swing from 50% to 75%. Swing lets you "shuffle" your beats—from subtle to extreme.

Use the Shift Timing field to shift all events by clock ticks.

Use the Window field to set how many events around a quantize value will be quantized. Any events outside this range will not be quantized; events inside will.

Use the Strength field to set how strictly events will be quantized (i.e., shifted toward the quantize value). Lower values move events a little bit towards the closest quantize value, resulting in a less mechanical feel than a strict quantization (a higher value).

Use the Events selector to set the target range for the time correction. You can apply the time correction to All note events or to just the Selected ones. To select note events to which to apply time correction, either use the various tools in the editors, or press or click the pad with the desired events (while Hitting Pad Selects All Events is set to On). You must do this before opening the Time Correct window.

When Range is selected, you can define the locations (From and To) as well as the pads or keys that will be quantized. When applying time correction to an audio track region, you will not be able to specify pads or keys.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_103_744651.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_103_744651.jpg)

To clear the track, click the menu icon (=), select Edit > Track, and click Clear. Alternatively, right-click the

Track field in the Inspector and click Clear. Click Clear to continue or Cancel to return to the previous screen.

- The Explode function immediately splits the current MIDI track into multiple MIDI tracks - one for each distinct pad or note (pitch, not event). The current track also remains present and intact, while each track created from it is labeled with the track name and pad name or number. This cannot be used on audio tracks.

To explode the track, select the MIDI tab, click the menu icon (≡), select Edit > Track, and click Explode.

- The Events Double Speed function immediately halves the lengths of all note events on the track as well as the distance between them. In other words, the track's notes are pressed closer together so the track sounds like it is playing at twice the previous speed. This does not actually affect the pitches of notes or the tempo.

To double the speed of all note events in the track, click the menu icon (=), select Edit $>$ Track, and click Events Double Speed.

- The Events Half Speed function immediately doubles the lengths of all note events on the track as well as the distance between them. In other words, the track's notes are spread further apart so the track sounds like it is playing at half of the previous speed. This does not actually affect the pitches of notes or the tempo.

To halve the speed of all note events in the track, click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, select Edit $>$ Track, and click Events Double Speed.

- The Split Events function divides all notes or the selected notes into multiple parts.

To split note events, click the menu icon $\equiv$ ), select Edit $>$ Track, and then Split Events. Select one of the preset number of events (2-9), or click Split Events... to open the Split Events Setup window.

- The Next Track and Previous Track options select the next or previous track in your sequence (respectively).

To select the next or previous track, click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$ , select Edit $>$ Track, and click Next Track or Previous Track (respectively).

- Export as MIDI lets you export the current track as a standard MIDI (.mid) file.

To export the track as a MIDI file, click the menu icon (=), select Edit > Track, and click Export as MIDI. Alternatively, right-click the Track field in the Inspector and click Export as MIDI.

In the Export Current Track as Standard MIDI file window, do any of the following:

To select the storage device you want to view, click the down arrow $\left( \nabla \right)$ next to the file path. If you have storage devices connected to your MPC hardware, they will appear in this column, as well.

To enter a folder, double-click it or press Enter.

To create a new folder, click New Folder, type a name for the new folder, and then click OK or press Enter to confirm the name, or click Cancel or press Esc to keep the original name. You will immediately enter the new folder.

- The Bounce to Sample function immediately renders the track as an audio sample and places it in the project’s sample pool. By default, it will be named Bounce - and appended with the sequence name. If you have already used this function on this sequence, then it will create another audio sample appended with the next-highest number.

To bounce the track to a sample, click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, select Edit $>$ Track, and click Bounce to Sample. Alternatively, right-click the Track field in the Inspector and click Bounce to sample.

- The Bounce to New Audio Track function immediately renders the track (for the current sequence only) as an audio track in the project. The Main Mode will automatically switch to the Audio tab, and the original track will be muted. By default, it will be named Audio and appended with a number (e.g., Audio 002). This function does not work for tracks that use MIDI programs or CV programs.

To bounce the MIDI track to an audio track, click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, select Edit $>$ Track, and click Bounce to New Audio Track. Alternatively, right-click the Track field in the Inspector and click Bounce to new audio track.

## Program

You can use any of these functions on the currently selected program. These functions are shown in the menu (Edit > Program) only if the MIDI tab is selected in the Inspector.

- The Flatten Pad option opens the Flatten Pad window where you can select a pad whose layered samples will be consolidated into a single audio sample on just its first layer. This function renders all samples on a pad as an audio sample and places it on the first layer of that pad. The resulting sample is the audio signal produced by that pad at full velocity (127) after the pad channel strip, which means that it includes any assigned pad insert effects and the results of warping the sample. This function is useful if you need to reduce how CPU-intensive a pad or program is by essentially "embedding" the warping and effects in the sample itself. By default, it will use the name of the first sample. This function works for drum programs only. (This is the same as the Flatten Pad button shown at the top of the touchscreen in Program Edit Mode.)

To flatten the samples of a pad, click the menu icon (=), select Edit $>$ Program, and click Flatten Pad.

Use the $\mathbf{{Pad}}$ menu to select the pad whose samples you want to flatten. Alternatively, press the desired pad. Use the Name field to enter a name for the flattened sample.

Use the Tail Length field to set the length of the audio tail. This will add extra seconds to the end of the resulting audio file. This is useful if you are using effects or samples whose sounds exceed the defined audio length (e.g., long reverb or delay, one-shot samples with long decays, etc.). We recommend using an audio tail of at least a couple of seconds.

Click Do it to continue or Cancel to return to the previous screen.

## Effects

You can apply various effects to the pads, keygroups, audio tracks, programs, submixes, and main outputs, using insert and send/return effects. This chapter can help you get a good overall understanding of how the effects work.

See Appendix > Effects & Parameters for a list of all available effects (with a brief description of each) and their editable parameters.

## Overview

In a program, each pad or keygroup can have up to four insert effects applied to it. An entire program can have up to four insert effects applied to it, as well.

An audio track, like a program, can have up to four insert effects applied to it, as well.

For even further flexibility, each submix can have up to four insert effects applied to it. You can route pads, keygroups, audio tracks, or programs to a submix, which is then routed to a main output.

Additionally, each pad, keygroup, audio track, program, and submix can be sent to (up to) four return channels (returns), each of which can have up to four insert effects of their own. Their audio will be routed through the insert effects on those returns, and the processed audio will be sent to a main output.

Finally, you can apply up to four insert effects to each main output (a stereo pair of channels: Outputs 1/2, Outputs $3/4$, etc.).

When you create an audio mixdown of a sequence or song, you can choose whether or not main insert effects are included or send/return effects are included, depending on what you are mixing down:

If you are creating an audio mixdown of a pair of main outputs, you can choose whether or not main insert effects will be included in the mixdown.

If you are creating an audio mixdown of separate programs or exploded tracks, you can choose whether or not send/return effects will be included in the mixdown.

See Audio Mixdown to learn about these options.

The Sampler and Looper handle effects differently:

The Sampler can use up to four insert effects, which are applied to the audio as you record it. This means that the effects cannot be “removed” from the sound later. Learn more about the Sampler in the Modes $>$ Sampler chapter.

Similarly, the Looper can use up to four insert effects, which are applied to the audio as you record it. This means that the effects cannot be "removed" from the sound later. Learn more about the Looper in the Modes $>$ Looper chapter.

Please see the rest of this chapter to learn how to use insert effects as well as send/return effects.

You can load, edit, remove, and activate or deactivate effects in the Inserts section of a channel strip. Each Inserts section has four insert effect slots.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_113_237042.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_113_237042.jpg)

To load an effect, double-click an empty slot in the Inserts section of a channel strip. In the window that appears:

Double-click an effect or click it and then click Select to load it.

Click the gear icon to open the Plugin Manager. See Plugins $>$ Plugin Manager to learn about this.

Click Close or press Esc to close the window without loading any effect.

You can also click the top of any Inserts section to save or load a factory or custom FX Rack. See Addenda $>$ Updates in MPC 2.10 $>$ New Features $> {FX}$ Racks for more information.

To remove a loaded effect, double-click the down arrow ( $\mathbf{v}$ ) next to its name the Inserts section. In the window that appears, double-click the <none> option at the top of the list of effects or click it once and then click Select.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_113_718670.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_113_718670.jpg)

To edit an effect, double-click its name in the Inserts section of a channel strip. A window with the effect's parameters will appear.

To adjust a parameter, click and drag its knob up or down. To make finer adjustments, press and hold Ctrl (Windows) or # (macOS) and then click and drag its knob up or down.

To enable or disable the effect, click the On/Off button in the upper-left corner.

To keep the window on top at all times, click the down arrow $\left( \bullet \right)$ in the upper-right corner so it becomes an up arrow $\left( \bullet \right)$ . Click it again to allow the window to be hidden under others.

To close the window, click the $\mathbf{X}$ in the upper-right corner.

To activate or deactivate an effect, click the on/off button next to it.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_113_413186.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_113_413186.jpg)

To deactivate all four effects, click the on/off button next to Inserts so it turns gray (off). Previously active effects will be off even though the button appears to be on.

To reactivate the previously active effects, click the on/off button next to Inserts so it turns blue (on).

To move an effect from one slot to another, click and drag it from its original slot to another slot (the new slot will be outlined in yellow before you release it). The effect will retain all of its editable parameters.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_113_489092.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_113_489092.jpg)

To copy an effect from one slot to another, press and hold Alt (Windows) or Option (macOS) and then click and drag it from its original slot to another slot (the new slot will be yellow before you release it). The effect will retain all of its editable parameters.

## Insert Effects

Insert effects can be applied to a pad, keygroup, audio track, program, submix or main output. The audio signal produced by that source is processed by any insert effect/effects that are loaded to that source (in the Inserts section of its channel strip) and activated. Each one can have up to four insert effects loaded and activated.

Below is an outline of where you can set the effects for a pad, keygroup, audio track, program, submix, or main output. Note:

If the Inserts section is not shown in a channel strip in the Inspector, click the menu icon (=), go to View $>$ Inspector, and click Inserts.

If the Inserts section is not shown in a channel strip in the Pad Mixer or Channel Mixer, click the box icon.

Pad: You can load up to four insert effects to each pad. The Inserts section for a pad is available in two places:

- the pad channel strip in the Inspector (in any mode)

- the pad channel strip in the Pad Mixer

Tip: When using pad insert effects, they will be applied to the selected pad only. This means that you could apply unique combinations of effects to each pad within a program. If you want to apply the same effect to all pads, do this with a program insert effect.

Keygroup: You can load up to four insert effects to each keygroup. The Inserts section for a keygroup is available in two places:

- the keygroup channel strip in the Inspector (in any mode)

- the keygroup channel strip in the Pad Mixer

Important: When using keygroup insert effects, they will be applied to that keygroup only. Keep this in mind if you load insert effects to multiple keygroups with overlapping note ranges - the effects will overlap in that range as well.

Audio Track: You can load up to four insert effects to each audio track. The Inserts section for an audio track is available in three places:

- the audio track channel strip in the Inspector

- the audio track channel strip in the Pad Mixer

- the audio track channel strip in the Channel Mixer

Program: You can load up to four insert effects to each program. The Inserts section for a program is available in

three places:

- the program channel strip in the Inspector

- the program channel strip in the Pad Mixer

- the program channel strip in the Channel Mixer

Submix: You can load up to four insert effects to each submix. The Inserts section for a submix is available only in the submix channel strip in the Channel Mixer.

Main Output: You can load up to four insert effects to each main output (a stereo pair of channels: Outputs 1/2, Outputs 3/4, etc.). The Inserts section for a main output is available in two places:

- the main channel strip in the Inspector

- the main channel strip in the Channel Mixer MPC

## Send/Return Effects

Send/return effects work in the following way:

1. A pad, keygroup, audio track, program, or submix can send its audio to a return at a designated send level.

2. That audio is processed by the effects on the return. Each return can have up to four insert effects loaded and activated.

3. The processed audio is sent to a pair of main outputs (stereo) or a single main output (mono).

There are four available returns. Any pad, keygroup, audio track, program, or submix can send its audio to any combination of those returns at the same time.

You can load send/return effects and set the return levels in two places:

- the return channel strip in the Inspector

- the return channel strip in the Channel Mixer

Below is a description of where to set the desired send levels for a pad, keygroup, audio track, program, or submix. Note:

If the Send knobs are not shown in a channel strip in the Inspector, click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, go to View $>$ Inspector, and click Sends. 出

If the Send knobs are not shown in a channel strip in the Pad Mixer or Channel Mixer, click the four-circles icon.

Pad: The Send knobs for a pad are available in two places:

- the pad channel strip in the Inspector (in any mode)

- the pad channel strip in the Pad Mixer

Keygroup: The Send knobs for a keygroup are available in two places:

- the keygroup channel strip in the Inspector (in any mode)

- the keygroup channel strip in the Pad Mixer

Important: When using keygroup send/return effects, they will be applied to that keygroup only. Keep this in mind if you use send/return effects with multiple keygroups with overlapping note ranges-the effects will overlap in that range as well.

Audio Track: The Send knobs for an audio track are available in three places:

- the audio track channel strip in the Inspector

- the audio track channel strip in the Pad Mixer

- the audio track channel strip in the Channel Mixer

Program: The Send knobs for a program are available in three places:

- the program channel strip in the Inspector

- the program channel strip in the Pad Mixer

- the program channel strip in the Channel Mixer

Submix: The Send knobs for a submix are available only in the submix channel strip in the Channel Mixer.

## Automation

You can set the automation for programs and audio tracks to be "written," "read," or disabled entirely. You can do this globally or for individual programs and audio tracks.

## Global

A button in the upper-right corner of the $\mathbf{{toolbar}}$ controls the global automation. When you click this button to change its state, it will change the automation state for all programs in the project. (If you have changed the automation state of an individual program or audio track as described below, then this global automation button will indicate that rather than the global automation state.)

## Click this global automation button to toggle between two states:

When set to $\operatorname{\mathbf{R} \mathbf{e} \mathbf{a} \mathbf{d} }\left( \mathbf{R} \right)$, automation data will be read but not recorded. You can still manually edit and ${D}_{0}R$ enter automation. (Think of this as a protective feature to prevent accidental changes to your automation while recording.)

When set to Write (W), automation can be recorded and will overwrite any existing automation. (Make Paw sure not to touch Q-Link knobs accidentally while you are recording.)

Press and hold Shift on your keyboard and click the global automation button to disable or enable global automation. When off, automation data will be ignored.

Important: If you have already recorded automation and turn it off, the track will still use the effect and its parameter values at the point where you turned it off.

## Programs & Audio Tracks

You can also set the automation for each program or audio track by using the program/audio track automation button in the channel strip for that program or audio track (shown in the Inspector, Pad Mixer, and Channel Mixer). Automation is available for all program types.

Note: Remember that clicking the global automation button will change the automation state for all programs in the project; if they were originally different, all of them will then match the global automation state.

## Click this program/audio track automation button to toggle between two states:

When set to Read (R), the program will read automation data but will not record any additional

automation over it. You can still manually edit and enter automation. (Think of this as a protective POR feature to prevent accidental changes to your automation while recording.)

When set to Write (W), the program can record automation. (If you have any Q-Link knobs assigned REW to automatable parameters, make sure not to touch any accidentally while you are recording.)

Press and hold Shift on your keyboard and click the program/audio track automation button to disable or enable program/audio track automation. When off, the program will ignore automation data. Pro

Important: If you have already recorded automation and turn it off, the track will still use the effect and its parameter values at the point where you turned it off. MPC

## Recording Automation

Automating various parameters is a good way to add some motion and dynamism to your sequences.

You can automate three types of parameters for MIDI tracks:

- Track Parameters:

- the mixer parameters of the track (Volume, Pan, Mute, and Solo)

- the MIDI CCs of the track (0-127)

- aftertouch messages

- pitch bend messages

- channel pressure messages

- program change messages

- Program Parameters (not available for MIDI programs):

- the mixer parameters of the program (Volume, Pan, Mute, Solo, and Send 1-4)

- parameters of the program (options vary based on the type of program)

- parameters for insert effects on the program (options vary based on the effect)

- Pad Parameters (for drum programs, keygroup programs, and clip programs):

- the mixer parameters of the pad/keygroup (Level, Pan, Pad Mute, Pad Solo, or Send 1-4)

- parameters of the pad/keygroup (options vary based on the type of program)

- parameters for insert effects on the pad/keygroup (options vary based on the effect)

You can automate only one set of parameters for audio tracks:

- Audio Track Parameters:

- the mixer parameters of the audio track (Volume, Pan, Mute, Solo, and Send 1-4)

- parameters for insert effects on the audio track (options vary based on the effect)

To enter automation for track parameters on a MIDI track:

1. Select the track, and then click Rec $\left( \bullet \right)$ or Overdub $\left( \oplus \right)$ to record-arm it.

2. Click Play (D) or Play Start (D) to start playback of the sequence.

3. Use whatever controls you want to adjust the parameter/parameters as the sequence plays. Your changes will

be recorded in real time. Note that recording automation is not an overdub-style process (even if you clicked

Overdub to record-arm the track); when the sequence repeats, it will overwrite/replace any automation that was previously recorded.

4. Click Stop ( $\blacksquare$ ) to stop the automation recording.

Alternatively, create the automation curves manually (see Editing Automation to learn how to do this).

## To record automation of a program parameter or pad parameter:

1. Set the program/audio track automation button to the red Write (W) option for any program or audio track whose parameters (or pad parameters) you want to automate. Alternatively, click the global automation button in the upper-right corner of the window to change the state of all programs and audio tracks.

2. Click Play (D) or Play Start (D) to start playback of the sequence.

3. Use whatever controls you want to adjust the parameter/parameters as the sequence plays. Your changes will be recorded in real time. Note that recording automation is not an overdub-style process; when the sequence repeats, it will overwrite/replace any automation that was previously recorded.

4. Click Stop ( $\blacksquare$ ) to stop the automation recording.

Once you are done, we recommend setting the program/audio track automation button for that program or audio track to the green Read (R) option. This ensures your track uses the automation you just recorded when you play it back (and will not be overwritten by any future adjustments you make to parameters during sequence playback).

## Editing Automation

You can use automation editing tools to adjust or create automation curves for all available parameters.

To edit automation of a program parameter or pad parameter, use the automation lane in the Grid Editor:

1. In the Grid Editor, make sure the automation lane is shown. If it is not, click the up arrow (^) in the lower-left corner of the Grid Editor.

2. Click the down arrow ( $\mathbf{\nabla }$ ) in the lower-left corner of the Grid Editor. Use the menu and submenus that appear to select the desired parameter. The parameter name will then appear below Modifier.

3. Use the pencil and marquee tools described below to create and edit automation for this parameter in the automation lane.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_118_390871.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_118_390871.jpg)

Use these tools in the Grid Editor to create or edit the automation curve in the automation lane. See $\mathbf{E}{ditors} >$ Grid Editor to learn more about using the Grid Editor in general.

Important: An automation curve consists of several points placed according to current time division-aligned with the quantization grid). You can create or move points without restricting them to the time division by pressing and holding Shift.

Pencil: Draw Mode:

To create a point, click the desired location in the automation lane.

To select a point, click it.

To move a point, click and drag it to another location in the automation lane. Press and hold Shift while doing this to move it without restricting ("snapping") it to the quantization grid.

To erase a point, double-click it.

口 Marquee: Marquee Mode: To select a point, click it.

To select multiple points, click and drag across the automation lane to create a box around them.

To move a point, click and drag it to another location in the automation lane. Press and hold Shift while doing this to move it without restricting ("snapping") it to the quantization grid.

To move multiple points, select them as described above, and then click and drag them to another location in the automation lane. Press and hold Shift while doing this to move them without restricting ("snapping") them to the quantization grid.

To edit automation of a track parameter for a MIDI track, use the automation lane in the Grid Editor, as described above. Alternatively, use the $\operatorname{\mathsf{T} \mathsf{r} ack}\operatorname{\mathbf{V} \mathbf{i} \mathbf{e} \mathbf{w} }$ in Track View Mode, the Channel Mixer, or Track Mute Mode.

## To edit automation of a track parameter in the Track View:

1. In the Track View, make sure the tracks you want are shown. If they are not, click menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$ in the upper-right corner, and select or deselect Show Unused Tracks, Show Programs, Show Audio Tracks, and Show Midi Tracks.

2. Click the A icon in the upper-left corner so it is white. The menu next to will be enabled, and Automation and its editing tools will appear above the middle of the Track View.

3. Click the menu next to the $\mathbf{A}$ icon to select the desired parameter.

4. Use the pencil and marquee tools described below to create and edit the automation curve for this parameter in the track strip or program strip.

MIDI track, audio track, and program strips appear slightly differently while displaying their automation curves:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_119_283635.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_119_283635.jpg)

Use these tools in the Track View Editor to create or edit the automation curve. See $\mathbf{{Track}}$ . View to learn more about using the Track View in general.

To open the Audio Mixdown window, click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, and go to File > Export and click As Audio Mixdown.

## Audio Length

Use the Start Bar and End Bar fields to define where the resulting audio file will start and end, respectively.

Use the Audio Tail field to add extra seconds to the end of the resulting audio file. This is useful if you are using effects or samples whose sounds exceed the defined audio length (e.g., long reverb or delay, one-shot samples with long decays, etc.). We recommend using an audio tail of at least a couple of seconds.

## Render Source

Select Stereo Output and use the adjacent field to select a pair of outputs: Out 1,2-31,32. The mixdown will be taken from these outputs.

Select Separate Programs to create a mixdown of each program used in the sequence or song.

Select Explode Tracks to create a mixdown of each track used in the sequence (you cannot use this option for an entire song).

Important: Each pad or keygroup must have their output routed to Program to be included in the mixdown. This is the typical (and default) setting.

## Render Options

If your Render Source is set to Stereo Output, select Main Inserts to include main insert effects in the mixdown.

If your Render Source is set to Separate Programs or Explode Tracks, select Export Returns to include return buses in the mixdown.

If your Render Source is set to Stereo Output, click Save as Project Preview to save the sequence or song as a project preview file (which you can play for reference in the Browser). If you select this box, Stereo Output will automatically be selected, as well.

## File Formats

Click WAV, AIFF, MP3, FLAC or OGG to select the file format of the mixdown.

For WAV and AIFF files, use the Bit Depth field to select a bit depth of 8, 16, or 24 bits, or 32 bits, floating point (32 F). For FLAC files, you can select a bit depth of 16 or 24 bits. For MP3 and OGG files, you can select a Bitrate of 128, 160, 192, or 320 kbps.

Use the Sample Rate field to select a sample rate of 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, or 96 kHz. In most cases, we recommend selecting $\mathbf{{44}.1}\mathbf{{kHz}}$ .

Click Export to enter the Save screen where you can select a name and location to save your audio mixdown.

Drum Programs: Each pad will show the samples assigned to it (all four layers). Click the Pad Bank letters to access additional pads or the full range of notes. For keygroup programs, Pad D13 plays the sample at its original pitch. Click a pad to play its sample/samples or note.

Keygroup Programs, Plugin Programs, MIDI Programs, and CV Programs: Each pad will show the note it will play as both a MIDI note number $\left( {\mathbf{0} - \mathbf{{127}}}\right)$ and note value (e.g., $\mathbf{C} - \mathbf{1},\overline{\mathbf{G}}\# \mathbf{5}$, etc.). Click the $\mathbf{{Pad}}$ Bank letters to access the full range of notes. Click a pad to play its note.

Clip Programs: Each pad will show the loop (clip) assigned to it. Click the Pad Bank letters to access additional banks of clips. Click a pad to launch that clip. (If the clip belongs to a mute group, other clips in that mute group will stop playing when that clip starts. See Program Edit Mode $>$ Program Editor $>$ Clip Programs to learn about this.)

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_130_453651.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_130_453651.jpg)

Each pad can also display a color, which you can customize for each program. See General Features $>$ Pad Color to learn how to do this.

When the Audio tab is selected in Main Mode, the Pads panel is not available.

## Pad Perform

In Main Mode, the Pad Perform panel is available for assigning the pads in a keygroup program, MIDI program, plugin program, or CV program to specific scales, chords, or progressions.

Use the Type selector determine what will be mapped over the pads:

Off: The pads use standard mapping.

Chromatic: Each pad is assigned a note, ascending by one semitone with each pad. Pads with notes in the key determined by the Scale will be lit, while pads with notes between the scale degrees will be unlit.

Notes: Each pad is assigned a note, ascending by one scale degree with each pad.

Chords: Each pad is assigned a chord, the root note ascending by one scale degree with each pad. All available chords will play in the key determined by the Scale.

Chromatic Chords: Each pad is assigned a chord, the root note ascending by one scale degree with each pad. You can play any chord type regardless of the key determined by the Scale. Essentially, this is like the Chords setting but with more options to play chords out of the set key.

Progressions: Each pad is assigned a chord in a chord progression. You can play the pads in (or out of) order to construct songs quickly. The available chords are determined by the Chord field. Custom:

Use the Pad Rows selector to determine how the notes are mapped across the pad banks.

Continuous: Pad 01 of one bank is always one scale degree higher than Pad 16 of the previous bank.

Start on Root: Pad 01 will always be the root note of the scale in every pad bank.

Use the Root Note field to set the starting point of the scale. The available notes are all chromatic notes across the range of the pads. The pad that's assigned the root note will be lit differently (and highlighted on the screen) to indicate where the scale starts in each octave.

Use the Scale field to set the scale or mode based on the root note (this is disabled when Type is set to Progressions). The available scales are:

<table><tr><td>Major</td><td>Blues (minor)</td><td>Major Bebop</td><td>Lydian</td></tr><tr><td>Natural Minor</td><td>Flamenco</td><td>Whole Tone</td><td>Mixolydian</td></tr><tr><td>Harmonic Minor</td><td>Gypsy</td><td>Chromatic</td><td>Aeolian</td></tr><tr><td>Pentatonic Major</td><td>Hungarian Gypsy</td><td>Dorian</td><td>Locrian</td></tr><tr><td>Pentatonic Minor</td><td>Persian</td><td>Phrygian</td><td></td></tr></table>

Use the Octave field to set the starting octave for the Root Note.

Use the Velocity field to set the pads to respond to velocity As played, or trigger at a fixed velocity for all note on messages at 12%, 18%, 25%, 31%, 37%, 43%, Half, 56%, 62%, 68%, 75%, 81%, 87%, 93% or Full velocity.

When $\mathsf{{Type}}$ is set to $\mathbf{{Chords}}$ , use the $\mathbf{{Scale}}$ Chord field to determine what chord type will play when pressing a pad. The chord will use those scale degrees based off the pad's root note.

1-3-5 (major/minor) 1-3-5-7 (major7/minor7)

1-4-5 (sus4) 1-3-5-7b (dominant)

1-2-5 (sus2)

When Type is set to Chromatic Chords, use the Chromatic Chord field to determine what chord type will play when pressing a pad. The chord will that chord shape based off the pad's root note.

## Program Edit Mode

98 Program Edit Mode contains all parameters for editing your Programs. For drum programs, this mode includes the parameters of four layers as well as all synthesis parameters and insert effect settings. See the Drum Programs section to learn more.

For keygroup programs, this mode contains slightly more parameters than drum programs. See the Keygroup Programs section to learn more.

For plugin programs, this mode shows the graphical user interface for the plugin. Skip to Plugin Programs to learn more.

For clip programs, this mode looks very different from that of other programs due to how clip launching works. See the Clip Programs section to learn more.

For MIDI programs and CV programs, skip to MIDI Programs and CV Programs.

For general information on the differences between the types of programs, please see General Features $>$ Programs.

To enter Program Edit Mode, do any of the following:

- Click the four-pads icon in the toolbar (if shown).

- Click the down arrow ( $\mathbf{\nabla }$ ) next to the other mode icons in the toolbar, and click Program Edit.

- Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, and go to View $>$ Mode and click Program Edit.

The upper half of the window can display the Grid Editor, Wave Editor, or List Editor. Click the Grid, Wave, or List tab to enter the corresponding editor. See General Features $>$ Editors to learn more about each one.

The lower half of the window can display the Q-Links panel, Pads panel, Program Editor panel, and Project panel. Click the corresponding selector to show or hide each one. See General Features $>$ Panels to learn more about the Q-Links or Project panels. The Pads panel is described in this chapter here. The Program Editor panel is described in this chapter here.

## Pads

When the MIDI tab is selected in Program Edit Mode, the Pads panel shows information for each pad, depending on the currently selected program.

Drum programs: Each pad will show the samples assigned to it (all four layers). Click the Pad Bank letters to access additional pads or the full range of notes.

Keygroup programs, Plugin programs, MIDI programs, and CV programs: Each pad will show the note it will play as both a MIDI note number $\left( {\mathbf{0} - \mathbf{{127}}}\right)$ and note value (e.g., C-1, G#5, etc.). Click the Pad Bank letters to access the full range of notes. Click a pad to play its note.

Clip programs, each pad will show the loop (clip) assigned to it. Click the Pad Bank letters to access additional banks of clips. Click a pad to launch that clip. (If the clip belongs to a mute group, other clips in that mute group will stop playing when that clip starts. See Program Editor $>$ Clip Programs to learn about this.)

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_135_272014.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_135_272014.jpg)

Each pad can also display a color, which you can customize for each program. See General Features $>$ Pad Color to learn how to do this. In Program Edit Mode, these colors will be displayed only when the pad is being played with the exception of clip programs, whose pad colors will always be displayed to help you distinguish the pads’ mute groups.

When the Audio tab is selected in Program Edit Mode, the Pads panel is not available.

## Program Editor

When the MIDI tab is selected in Program Edit Mode, the Program Editor shows different settings depending on the type of program that is selected.

When the Audio tab is selected in Program Edit Mode, the Program Editor is non-functional.

When using a drum program, the Program Editor shows the parameters for each pad and the program overall.

To select a pad, press it. Its parameters will appear on the screen immediately.

In the Global section, set the playback mode and tuning for the overall program.

Note: The Sample Layers section has some parameters similar to those in this section (Semi, Fine). Remember that the Global section parameters control the overall settings for the sample, while Sample Layers controls the settings for each layer (up to 4).

Polyphony sets the playback mode for the program’s pads. In Mono Mode, only one pad will sound at a time. If a pad is played while another (or the same one) is still playing its sample/samples, the new pad will immediately mute all other currently playing pads in that program. In Poly Mode, several pads can be triggered at the same time (limited only by the total number of voices available).

Semi lets you transpose the program up to 36 semitones up or down.

Fine provides fine-tuning of the program up to 99 cents up or down.

In the Pad section, set the volume and panning for the current pad.

Note: The Sample Layers section has some parameters similar to those in this section (Level, Pan). Remember that the Pad section parameters control the overall settings for the sample, while Sample Layers controls the settings for each layer (up to 4).

Level controls the overall volume level of the loaded sample/samples.

Pan controls the overall panning of the loaded sample/samples in the stereo field.

The Simultaneous Play section lets you set up to four pads that can be triggered by pressing one pad only. This function is useful for triggering a stack of sounds (e.g., layered bass drums). Use each Pad menu to select the desired pad.

The Mute Targets section lets you select up to four pads (in the same program) for the currently selected pad. When the currently selected pad is played, it will immediately silence its mute targets. Use each Pad menu to select the desired mute target.

Tips:

This feature is useful for programming realistic hi-hats, especially if only the open or closed hat should be heard.

This feature is similar to the mute group feature, available for both drum programs and keygroup programs.

The Edit Zones section is an overview of any selected pads. Use the selector at the top to set how the selected pads will be edited:

Current: Only the currently selected pad will be edited.

Multiple: All selected pads will be edited simultaneously.

All: All pads will be edited simultaneously.

The Sample Layers section shows four layers, each of which can use an assigned sample. Each layer has identical, independently assignable parameters.

Click the Sample menu to select the sample for that layer. Remember that the sample has to be loaded into the project's sample pool beforehand.

Semi lets you transpose the selected layer up to 36 semitones up or down.

Fine provides fine-tuning of each layer up to 99 cents up or down.

Level lets you adjust each layer’s volume, letting you control the “balance” of the samples assigned to the pad.

Use the pan knob to adjust the stereo placement of the respective layer.

Use the Velocity slider to define the velocity range of each layer.

A range from 0 to 127 lets the layer respond to the entire velocity range which is input from the respective pad while, for example, a range from 100 to 127 lets the layer respond only to higher velocity levels. By assigning several samples of one instrument, you can create a realistic-sounding "multi-sample" by adjusting the velocity ranges of each layer accordingly.

For example, you may have three samples of a drum hit with low force, medium force, and high force. You can set each sample to a layer and set the Velocity ranges so only low velocities trigger the low-force sample, only mid-range velocities trigger the medium-force sample, and only high velocities trigger the high-force sample.

Use the Edit All Layers button to enable or disable editing control of all sample layers at the same time. When this is enabled, edits made to sample parameters such as Start/End points or Semi/Fine tuning on any one layer are automatically applied uniformly to all four layers at once (even if some layers are empty). See Addenda $>$ Updates in MPC 2.14 > New Features > Edit All Layers for more information.

The Randomize section lets you add randomized variety to the Pitch, Level, Pan, Sample Offset, and Envelope parameters of each layer sample. See Addenda $>$ Updates in MPC 2.10 $>$ New Features $>$ Drum and Keygroup Program Improvements for more information.

The Envelope section lets you create a variable control signal that can be used, for instance, to modulate the filter, amplitude, or pitch settings of a sound over a given period of time.

The Filter Envelope controls affect the filter frequency. Use the fields or click and drag the “handles” of the envelope to shape the envelope or time-variant modulation output. See the later Anatomy of an Envelope section to learn about the envelope parameters.

The Amp Envelope controls affect level changes over time. Use the fields or click and drag the "handles" of the envelope to shape the envelope or time-variant modulation output. See the later Anatomy of an Envelope section to learn about the envelope parameters.

The Pitch envelope controls affect the pitch of the sample. Use the fields or click and drag the “handles” of the envelope to shape the envelople or time-variant modulation output. See the later Anatomy of an Envelope section to learn about the envelope parameters.

The Filter section lets you set the type and characteristics of the filter.

Click the Type menu to select a filter for the selected pad. See Appendix $>$ Glossary $>$ Filter for an explanation of the available filter types. You can set the default Type setting for new drum programs and keygroup programs in Project tab of the Preferences (see General Features $>$ Preferences).

Use the Cutoff knob to set the cutoff frequency for low-pass and high-pass filter types or the center frequency for band-pass and band-stop filter types.

Use the $\operatorname{\mathbf{R} \mathbf{e} \mathbf{s} }$ knob to set the resonance/emphasis of the frequencies around the cutoff point.

Tip: Use values lower than 80 to give more brilliance to the sound. At values higher than 80, the sound will result in a strong audible boost around the cutoff frequency.

Use the Depth fields to determine the amount of influence the filter envelope has on the cutoff frequency. Higher settings will increase the modulation of the filter by the envelope; lower settings will result in only subtle changes of the filter Cutoff over time.

Tip: To give a sound a more distinctive attack, increase the Depth setting and set low Attack and Decay values as well as a medium-low Sustain value of the Filter Envelope. This will start a sound with the filter opened and close it shortly afterward, giving it a bright start followed by a darker sustain. String sounds, on the other hand, can sound much more "alive" with low Depth settings and a high Attack value, resulting in a slight fade-in of the higher frequencies.

The LFO section lets you select a periodic waveform generated by the low-frequency oscillator. You can adjust the frequency and shape for modulation purposes.

Click the Wave menu to select the LFO waveform type:

Sine (best suited for smooth modulations)

Triangle (best suited for smooth modulations)

S&H (samples a random value and holds it until the next value is generated)

Saw (can generate interesting filter or volume changes)

Saw Down (can generate interesting filter or volume changes)

Square (interesting results with hard-panning modulations)

Noise (generates random values and glides)

Use the Rate knobs to determine the LFO frequency when Sync is set to None. At lower values, it might take some time for the LFO to complete a cycle, while higher values will come closer to audible range.

Click the Sync menu to set how the LFO’s rate is synchronized with the tempo. You can select one of several time divisions. When None is selected, Sync is off.

Use the Destinations sliders to determine how much the LFO affects the pitch of the sound (Pitch), the cutoff frequency of the filter (Filter), the volume level of the sound (Amp) and panning of the sound (Pan).

The Pad Play Modes section lets you set the behavior for each pad’s samples in a drum program.

Click the Mute Group menu to assign the selected pad to one of the 32 available groups. When pads assigned to the same mute group receive MIDI notes, the last pad played will silence all other pads in that mute group. A mute group affects pads within that program only; mute groups do not affect pads in other programs.

Tip: This feature is useful for programming realistic hi-hats, especially if only the open or closed hat should be heard.

Click the Sample Play menu to determine how much of the sample is played.

One-Shot: The entire sample will play from start to end. Use this when you want to play short sounds.

Note-Off: The entire sample will play from start to end after the pad has been pressed and released.

Note-On: The sample will play only as long as the pad is held. This is better for longer samples so you can control a sound's duration by pressing and holding its corresponding pad. If this option is selected, the Filter Envelope and Amp Envelope will use an ADSR type rather than AD or AHDS (see Anatomy of an Envelope to learn about this).

Click the Pad Poly menu to determine how the pad’s sound behaves when multiple hits are registered. When set to Mono, only one pad will sound at a time. If a pad is played while another (or the same one) is still playing its sample/samples, the new pad will immediately mute all other currently playing pads in that program. When set to Poly, several pads can be triggered at the same time (limited only by the total number of voices available). You can also select a specific number of pads (2-64) so that you can trigger up to this many pads at the same time (unless they exceed the total number of voices available).

Click the Layer Play menu to determine how multiple samples assigned to the same pad are played:

Cycle: Each time the pad is played, it will play the next layer's sample. In other words, the samples will cycle through the layers as follows: $1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4\ldots$ etc.

Velocity: The pad will switch between layers depending on how hard you press a pad.

Random: Each time the pad is played, it will play one of its layer's samples at random.

The Modulation Sources section lets you set how much velocity is required to modulate certain other parameters as well as your filter envelope and amp envelope.

V>Start (Velocity+Start) sets how much velocity is needed (for a triggered pad) to modulate the sample start point.

Env Attack (Envelope Attack) sets how much velocity is needed (for a triggered pad) to modulate the Attack phase for the Amp envelope.

Env Depth (Envelope Depth) enables velocity information to control the amount of the filter envelope's effect on the cutoff frequency.

Cutoff uses the velocity to modulate the cutoff frequency directly.

The Velocity Sensitivity section determines how much the velocity affects the pitch of the sound (Pitch), the attack of the filter envelope (Attack), the volume level of the filter envelope (Amp) and or the panning of the sound (Pan). Use the sliders to adjust the setting of each.

When you press a pad softly, only minimal modulation is applied. When you press it harder, the modulation amount also gets stronger depending on the setting of the corresponding knob.

The Drum FX section allows you to use up to eight dedicated effects for each pad. There are eight available Drum FX slots, each with an adjustable parameter:

- Ring Mod - Rectifier

- Bit Crush - Bass Enhancer (Tight)

- Decimater - Bass Enhancer (Medium)

- Tube Drive - Bass Enhancer (Wide)

- Soft Clipper - Stereo Width

- Hard Clipper - Wave Folder

- Low Pass - Gain

- High Pass

When using a keygroup program, the Program Editor shows the parameters for each keygroup and the program overall. To select a keygroup, press a pad within that keygroup. Its parameters will appear on the screen immediately.

In the Global section, set the playback mode and tuning for the overall program.

Semi lets you tune the program up to 36 semitones up or down.

Fine provides fine-tuning of the program up to 99 cents up or down.

Trans shifts the pitch of the MIDI notes sent to the program up to 36 semitones up or down.

Polyphony sets the playback mode for the program’s keygroups. In Mono Mode, only one keygroup will sound at a time. If a keygroup is played while another (or the same one) is still playing its sample/samples, the new keygroup will immediately mute all other currently playing keygroups in that program. In Poly Mode, several keygroups can be triggered at the same time (limited only by the total number of voices available).

#KG (number of keygroups) lets you create up to 128 keygroups within a keygroup program. This is useful when working with multi-samples. For example, if you want to create a realistic piano, you can use different keygroups (e.g., 88 for a grand piano) with every keygroup containing its own sampled note (with up to four possible velocity layers).

## Use the Keygroup section to set the playback modes, level, tuning, and other settings for the keygroup.

Note: The Sample Layers section has some parameters similar to those in this section (Level, Pan, Semi, Fine). Remember that Keygroup section parameters control the overall settings for the sample, while Sample Layers controls the settings for each layer (up to 4).

The Keygroup Select field lets you select a specific keygroup for editing. This parameter works in conjunction with the #KG (number of keygroups) parameter at the top of the window, which lets you create up to 128 keygroups within one keygroup program. A default keygroup program contains only one single keygroup. When you have created more than one keygroup with $\# \mathbf{{KG}}$, use Keygroup Select to select any keygroup for editing. All selects all available keygroups of a keygroup program for simultaneous editing.

Semi lets you transpose the selected keygroup up to 36 semitones up or down.

Fine provides fine-tuning of each keygroup up to 99 cents up or down.

Level controls the overall volume level of the loaded sample/samples.

Pan controls the overall panning of the loaded sample/samples in the stereo field.

Key Track allows you to switch a sample’s automatic transposition on or off. If this is off, you will always hear the same pitch of the sample, no matter which note is triggered by pads or a connected MIDI keyboard.

Note Range lets you restrict the key range used for a sample’s playback. Only notes with a key number higher or equal (Lo) or lower and equal (Hi) to the selected value will trigger a sound.

Tip: Set the Lo parameter to A0 and the Hi parameter to C8 to emulate the range of a standard 88-key piano.

Click the $\mathbf{{KG}}$ Poly (keygroup polyphony) menu to determine how the keygroup will play. When set to $\mathbf{{Mono}}$ , only one pad will sound at a time. If a pad is played while another (or the same one) is still playing its sample/samples, the new pad will immediately mute all other currently playing pads in that program. When set to Poly, several pads can be triggered at the same time, limited only by the total number of voices available. You can also select a specific number of pads (2-64) so that you can play up to this many pads at the same time (unless they exceed the total number of voices available).

Click the Mute Group menu to assign the selected pad to one of the 32 available groups. When pads assigned to the same mute group receive MIDI notes, the last pad played will silence all other pads in that mute group. A mute group affects pads within that program only; mute groups do not affect pads in other programs.

Layer Play determines how multiple samples assigned to the same pad are played:

Cycle: Each time the pad is played, it will play the next layer's sample. In other words, the samples will cycle through the layers as follows: $1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4\ldots$ etc.

Velocity: The pad will switch between layers depending on how hard you press a pad.

Random: Each time the pad is played, it will play one of its layer's samples at random.

Sample Play determines how much of the sample is played:

One-Shot: The entire sample will play from start to end. Use this when you want to play short sounds.

Note-Off: The entire sample will play from start to end after the pad has been pressed and released.

Note-On: The sample will play only as long as the pad is held. This is better for longer samples so you can control a sound's duration by pressing and holding its corresponding pad. If this option is selected, the Filter Envelope and Amp Envelope will use an ADSR type rather than AD or AHDS (see Anatomy of an Envelope to learn about this).

The Sample Layers section shows four layers, each of which can use an assigned sample. Each layer has identical, independently assignable parameters.

Click the Sample menu to select the sample for that layer. Remember that the sample has to be loaded into the project's sample pool beforehand.

Semi lets you transpose the selected layer up to 36 semitones up or down.

Fine provides fine-tuning of each layer up to 99 cents up or down.

Level lets you adjust each layer’s volume, letting you control the "balance" of the samples assigned to the pad.

Use the pan knob to adjust the stereo placement of the respective layer.

Use the Velocity slider to define the velocity range of each layer.

A range from 0 to 127 lets the layer respond to the entire velocity range which is input from the respective pad while, for example, a range from 100 to 127 lets the layer respond only to higher velocity levels. By assigning several samples of one instrument, you can create a realistic-sounding "multi-sample" by adjusting the velocity ranges of each layer accordingly.

For example, you may have three samples of a piano key with low force, medium force, and high force. You can set each sample to a layer and set the Velocity ranges so only low velocities trigger the low-force sample, only mid-range velocities trigger the medium-force sample, and only high velocities trigger the high-force sample.

Root Note lets you set the key of the sample layer. This can be detected automatically by choosing SMP or manually by selecting a specific note.

Use the Edit All Layers button to enable or disable editing control of all sample layers at the same time. When this is enabled, edits made to sample parameters such as Start/End points or Semi/Fine tuning on any one layer are automatically applied uniformly to all four layers at once (even if some layers are empty). See Addenda $>$ Updates in MPC 2.14 > New Features > Edit All Layers for more information.

The Randomize section lets you add randomized variety to the Pitch, Level, Pan, Sample Offset, and Envelope parameters of each layer sample. See Addenda $>$ Updates in MPC 2.10 $>$ New Features $>$ Drum and Keygroup Program Improvements for more information.

The Envelope section lets you create a variable control signal that can be used, for instance, to modulate the filter, amplitude, or pitch settings of a sound over a given period of time.

The Filter Envelope controls affect the filter frequency. Use the fields or click and drag the “handles” of the envelope to shape the envelope or time-variant modulation output. See the later Anatomy of an Envelope section to learn about the envelope parameters.

The $\operatorname{\mathbf{A} \mathsf{m} \mathsf{p} }\operatorname{\mathbf{E} \mathbf{n} \mathbf{v} \mathbf{e} \mathbf{l} \mathbf{o} \mathbf{p} \mathbf{e} }$ controls affect level changes over time. Use the fields or click and drag the “handles” of the envelope to shape the envelope or time-variant modulation output. See the later Anatomy of an Envelope section to learn about the envelope parameters.

The Pitch envelope controls affect the pitch of the sample. Use the fields or click and drag the “handles” of the envelope to shape the envelople or time-variant modulation output. See the later Anatomy of an Envelope section to learn about the envelope parameters.

The Filter section lets you set the type and characteristics of the filter.

Click the Type menu to select a filter for the selected keygroup. See Appendix $>$ Glossary $>$ Filter for an explanation of the available filter types. You can set the default Type setting for new drum programs and keygroup programs in the Project tab of the Preferences (see General Features $>$ Preferences).

Use the Cutoff knob to set the cutoff frequency for low-pass and high-pass filter types or the center frequency for band-pass and band-stop filter types.

Use the $\operatorname{\mathbf{R} \mathbf{e} \mathbf{s} }$ knob to set the resonance/emphasis of the frequencies around the cutoff point.

Tip: Use values lower than 80 to give more brilliance to the sound. At values higher than 80 , the sound will result in a strong audible boost around the cutoff frequency.

Use the Depth field to determine the amount of influence the filter envelope has on the cutoff frequency. Higher settings will increase the modulation of the filter by the envelope; lower settings will result in only subtle changes of the filter Cutoff over time.

Tip: To give a sound a more distinctive attack, increase the Depth setting and set low Attack and Decay values as well as a medium-low Sustain value of the Filter Envelope. This will start a sound with the filter opened and close it shortly afterward, giving it a bright start followed by a darker sustain. String sounds, on the other hand, can sound much more "alive" with low Depth settings and a high Attack value, resulting in a slight fade-in of the higher frequencies.

The LFO section lets you select a periodic waveform generated by the low-frequency oscillator. You can adjust the frequency and shape for modulation purposes.

Click the Wave menu to select the LFO waveform type:

Sine (best suited for smooth modulations)

Triangle (best suited for smooth modulations)

S&H (samples a random value and holds it until the next value is generated)

Saw (can generate interesting filter or volume changes)

Saw Down (can generate interesting filter or volume changes)

Square (interesting results with hard-panning modulations)

Noise (generates random values and glides)

Use the Rate knobs to determine the LFO frequency when Sync is set to None. At lower values, it might take some time for the LFO to complete a cycle, while higher values will come closer to audible range.

Click the Sync menu to set how the LFO’s rate is synchronized with the tempo. You can select one of several time divisions. When None is selected, Sync is off.

Use the Destinations sliders to determine how much the LFO affects the pitch of the sound (Pitch), the cutoff frequency of the filter (Filter), the volume level of the sound (Amp) and panning of the sound (Pan).

## Plugin Programs

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_143_753101.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_143_753101.jpg)

When using a plugin program, the Program Editor shows the parameters of that plugin. Its appearance and available options depend on the plugin.

## MIDI Programs

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_143_255247.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_143_255247.jpg)

When using a MIDI program, the Program Editor shows a series of knobs corresponding to MIDI CC values-six banks of knobs with 16 knobs in each bank (a total of 96 knobs).

To set the MIDI CC of a knob, click the area above it next to down arrow icon ( $\mathbf{\nabla }$ ) and select a number from the menu.

To adjust the value that each MIDI CC sends, click and drag its knob.

To rename a MIDI control, double-click the name above the knob, and then use your keyboard to enter a new name. Press enter or click elsewhere to set the new name. MIDI programs can be saved with custom naming for use in multiple projects.

## Clip Programs

When using a clip program, the Program Editor shows various settings to determine how each pad launches its assigned sample (a loop called a clip).

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_144_517825.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_144_517825.jpg)

To select a pad, press it. Its parameters will appear in the Program Editor panel immediately, and it will appear in the Wave Editor in the upper half of the window (see General Features $>$ Editors $>$ Wave Editor to learn about this).

To learn how to assign a clip to a pad, use the menu at the top of the Pad section (described below) or see General Features $>$ Programs $>$ Clip Programs.

The Program section lets you adjust the program's overall tuning and quantization.

Semi lets you transpose the program up to 36 semitones up or down.

Fine provides fine-tuning of the program up to 99 cents up or down.

Click the Quantize menu to set the quantization of the program: 1/64 bar, 1/32 bar, 1/16 bar, 1/8 bar, 1/4 bar, 1/2 bar, 1 bar, 2 bars, 4 bars, 8 bars, or None. When set to None, the program will not follow any quantization at all.

The Pad section controls how the clip plays.

Click the menu at the top of the $\mathbf{{Pad}}$ section to select the clip you want to assign to the pad.

Use the $\mathbf{{Start}}$ or $\mathbf{{End}}$ fields to set the start point or end point of the region of the clip that will be played. Alternatively, click and drag the green start point marker and red end point marker in the Wave Editor.

Use the Pad Play field to determine how the clip is played.

One Shot: When you press the pad, the entire clip will play from start to end and then stop.

Toggle: When you press the pad, the entire clip will play from start to end and loop indefinitely. Pressing it again - or launching another in the same mute group-will stop its playback. This is the most common usage.

Semi lets you transpose the pad up to 36 semitones up or down.

Fine provides fine-tuning of the pad up to 99 cents up or down.

Click the Mute Group menu to assign the selected pad to one of the 32 available groups. When pads assigned to the same mute group receive MIDI notes, the last pad played will silence all other pads in that mute group. A mute group affects pads within that program only; mute groups do not affect pads in other programs.

Note: By default, each column of pads is assigned to the same mute group. This means only one pad from each column can be playing its clip at a time. You can use the Mute Group field to configure this any way you like, though.

Click the Pad Quantize menu to set the quantization of the pad: 1/64 bar, 1/32 bar, 1/16 bar, 1/8 bar, 1/4 bar, 1/2 bar, 1 bar, 2 bars, 4 bars, 8 bars, None, or Program. When set to Program, the pad uses the same quantization as the overall program (the Quantize field in the adjacent Program section). When set to Off, the pad will not follow any quantization at all.

Click Warp to lengthen or shorten the clip without changing its pitch, and use the BPM field to change the tempo. Use the Coarse and Fine sliders if you want to change the pitch.

Note: The Warp algorithms are very CPU-intensive and can result in audio drop-outs during playback if used too freely. Be mindful of how (and how often) you use the warp function.

Click Reverse to reverse the clip's audio.

Use the Fade button to apply a very small fade-in and fade-out at the start and end of the clip. This can help prevent "clicks" and glitches that may occur if the start point or end point is not placed at the waveform's "zero-crossings."

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_145_244191.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_145_244191.jpg)

When using a CV program, the Program Editor shows a series of knobs. The first eight knobs correspond to CV Outputs 1-8. Although this option is selectable, it is usable only with MPC hardware that has CV outputs (e.g., MPC X).

To set the CV output of a knob, click the area above it next to down arrow ( $\blacktriangledown$ ) and select an output from the menu. To adjust the voltage of each one, click and drag its knob.

To rename a CV control, double-click the name above the knob, and then use your keyboard to enter a new name. Press enter or click elsewhere to set the new name. CV programs can be saved with custom naming for use in multiple projects.

## Anatomy of an Envelope

An envelope creates a variable control signal. It can be used, for instance, to modulate the filter settings of a sound over a given period of time.

For drum programs, use the AD/AHDS selector to select an AD or AHDS envelope. When Sample Play is set to Note-On, it will use an ADSR envelope.

Keygroup programs use AHDS envelopes. When Sample Play is set to Note-On, it will use an ADSR envelope.

With AHDS envelopes, the following happens when you trigger a sample:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_146_989626.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_146_989626.jpg)

1. Within the period of time defined by Attack, the sample volume rises to its maximum value.

2. The sample's maximum volume will be maintained during the Hold phase.

3. During the Decay phase, the sample's volume will gradually drop to the Sustain level.

4. The sample's volume will stay at the Sustain level until the pad is released.

Use the additional A Shape and D Shape handles to adjust the curve of the Attack and Decay phases, respectively.

With AD envelopes, the following happens when you trigger a sample:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_146_824971.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_146_824971.jpg)

1. Within the period of time defined by Attack, the sample volume rises to its maximum value.

2. The sample's maximum volume will be maintained until its Decay phase, when the sample's volume will gradually drop to "zero" over the set duration. Click the Type drop-down menu to select how the decay functions:

Decay From Start: The volume will start decreasing immediately after reaching its maximum level.

Decay From End: The maximum volume will be maintained for a hold phase until it reaches the decay phase.

Use the additional A Shape and D Shape handles to adjust the curve of the Attack and Decay phases, respectively.

## With ADSR envelopes, the following happens when you trigger a sample:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_146_729351.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_146_729351.jpg)

1. Within the period of time defined by Attack, the sample volume rises to its maximum value.

2. During the Decay phase, the sample's volume will gradually drop to the Sustain level.

3. The sample's volume will stay at the Sustain level until the Release phrase begins.

4. The sample's volume will drop to "zero" over the duration set by Release.

Use the additional A Shape, D Shape and R Shape handles to adjust the curve of the Attack, Decay and Release phases, respectively.

Sample Edit Mode

Sample Edit Mode lets you edit samples using various functions.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_147_989252.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_147_989252.jpg)

To enter Sample Edit Mode, do any of the following:

- Click the waveform-and-flags icon in the toolbar (if shown).

- Click the down arrow ( $\mathbf{\nabla }$ ) next to the other mode icons in the toolbar, and click Sample Edit.

- Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, and go to View $>$ Mode and click Sample Edit.

- Double-click the desired sample in the Project panel or Project Info Browser.

- Right-click the desired sample in the Project panel or Project Info Browser, and click Edit.

To select a sample to edit, click it in the Project panel or Project Info Browser.

The upper half of the window shows the waveform. While you can edit the waveform in this part of the window, it is different from the standard Wave Editor.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_148_680277.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_148_680277.jpg)

The large waveform display shows the "active" section of the sample waveform. The strip above the large display shows an overview of the entire sample waveform. If the waveform display is showing only part of the entire sample waveform, a white box in the overview will indicate the current position.

The timeline provides a reference for the length of the sample. Click the down arrow $\left( \nabla \right)$ or right-click anywhere on the timeline to select the increments it will use: Time (secs:ms), Samples, or Beats.

Scroll left or right on the waveform to move through it. Use the sliders in the lower-right corner or click the timeline and drag down or up to zoom in or out.

The green marker and red marker are the start point and end point (respectively). These two points define the region of the sample that will be played.

To move the start point or end point of the selected region, do either of the following:

- Click and drag its marker left or right.

- Use the Start or End fields in the Parameters panel.

- Use the first column of $\mathbf{Q}$ -Link knobs to adjust the start point or the second column of $\mathbf{Q}$ -Link knobs to adjust the end point. The top-most Q-Link knob provides coarse adjustment (x1000), while the bottom-most one knob provides fine adjustment $\left( {\mathbf{x}\mathbf{1}}\right)$ .

Tip: A recorded sample may have some silence at the beginning or end, which makes it difficult to time it correctly in a musical context. Fix this by adjusting the start point. You can also adjust end point to remove any extra silence or unwanted audio at the end. In addition to making your workflow easier, having a "tight," well-edited sample can enhance your production or performance.

The lower half of the window can display the Q-Links panel, Pads panel, Parameters panel, and Project panel. Click the corresponding selector to show or hide each one. See General Features $>$ Panels $>$ Project to learn more about the Project panel.

The other three panels vary based on the current editing method: Trim Mode, Chop Mode, or Program Mode. The options for each mode are slightly different. Please refer to the following Trim Mode, Chop Mode, and Program Mode parts of this chapter to learn how each works.

Tip: You can use Trim Mode for a specific slice of the sample, previously created and selected in Chop Mode. This allows for a more detailed view of a single slice than in Chop Mode and gives you more options for auditioning the slice. You can easily switch between Trim Mode and Chop Mode while doing this.

## To use both Trim Mode and Chop Mode to edit a sample slice:

1. Click Chop in the Q-Links panel.

2. Set all fields as desired to create your sample slices.

3. Select the desired slice.

4. Click Trim in the Q-Links panel. The region you are now editing is indicated by the normal start point and end point markers rather than slice markers.

Click Chop at any time to return to Chop Mode.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_149_977253.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_149_977253.jpg)

We recommend using Trim Mode to simply crop the start and/or end from a sample.

To enter Trim Mode, click the Trim tab in the Q-Links panel.

## Q-Links

In the $\mathbf{Q}$ -Links panel:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_149_204784.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_149_204784.jpg)

Use the first column of $\mathbf{Q}$ -Link knobs to adjust the start point. This is the same as adjusting the Start field in the Parameters panel.

Use the second column of $\mathbf{Q}$ -Link knobs to adjust the end point. This is the same as adjusting the End field in the Parameters panel.

Use the third column of Q-Link knobs to adjust the loop point if Loop Lock is off. If Loop Lock is on, adjusting the loop point will also adjust the start point. This is the same as adjusting the Loop field in the Parameters panel.

Use Q-Link Knob 16 to select the desired slice, if the sample has been split into multiple slices in Chop Mode. This is the same as adjusting the Slice field in the Parameters panel.

Use Q-Link Knob 8 to scroll through the waveform in the large waveform display above.

Use Q-Link Knob 4 to zoom in or zoom out of the waveform.

For the first three columns, the top-most Q-Link knob provides coarse adjustment (x1000), while the bottom-most one knob provides fine adjustment (x1).

When Link Slices is enabled (after you have created slices in Chop Mode), changing the start point of a slice will also change the end point of the previous slice. Similarly, changing the end point of a slice will also change the start point of the next slice. Disable Link Slices if you are trying to create slices that use non-contiguous parts of the sample. This is the same as clicking the gear icon in the upper-right corner of the Wave Editor and using the Link Slices submenu.

Important: Link Slices must be disabled to make slices nonsequential, noncontiguous, or overlapping.

Enable Zero Snap to force start points, end points, and loop points to occur only at the waveform's "zero-crossings." This can help to avoid clicks and glitches when playing a sample. This is the same as clicking the gear icon in the upper-right corner of the Wave Editor and using the Zero Snap submenu. Pads

The Pads panel enables you to play certain parts of the selected sample:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_150_944737.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_150_944737.jpg)

Play Sample (One Shot) (Pad 10) plays the sample once from the start point to the end point. Press the pad once to play it.

Play Sample (Note On) (Pad 11) plays the sample once from the start point to the end point. Press and hold the pad to play it, and release the pad to stop playing it. Alternatively, click and hold anywhere in the waveform display.

Play Loop Continuous (Pad 16) plays the sample repeatedly from the loop point to the end point.

Play Loop (Pad 13) plays the sample from the loop point to the end point. Press and hold the pad to play it, and release the pad to stop playing it.

Play to Loop Start (Pad 14) plays the part of the sample just before the loop point. Press and hold the pad to play it, and release the pad to stop playing it.

Play from Loop Start (Pad 15) plays the sample from the loop point to the end of the sample regardless of the end point. Press and hold the pad to play it, and release the pad to stop playing it.

Play All (Pad 9) plays the entire sample.

Pads 1-4 have the same respective functions as Pads 5-8, but Pads 1-4 play the sample part as "One Shots" (pressing the pad once will play the entire part) while Pads 5-8 play the sample part as "Note Ons" (pressing the pad and holding it will play the part; releasing it will stop playback):

Play from Start (Pad 1, Pad 5) plays the sample from the start point to the end point.

Play to Start (Pad 2, Pad 6) plays the part of the sample just before the start point to the start point.

Play to End (Pad 3, Pad 7) plays the part of the sample just before the end point to the end point.

Play from End (Pad 4, Pad 8) plays the part of the sample from the end point to the end of the sample.

## Parameters

The Parameters panel includes controls for editing the sample length and tuning as well as buttons for assigning the sample (see this section) and processing the slice or sample (see this section).

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_151_600393.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_151_600393.jpg)

Use the Slice field to select the desired slice, if the sample has been split into multiple slices in Chop Mode. This is the same as adjusting Q-Link Knob 16 in the Q-Links panel.

Use the Start field to adjust the start point. This is the same as adjusting the first column of $\mathbf{Q}$ -Link knobs in the $\mathbf{Q}$ -Links panel.

Use the End field to adjust the end point. This is the same as adjusting the second column of Q-Link knobs in the Q-Links panel.

Use the Loop field to adjust the loop point if Loop Lock is off. If Loop Lock is on, adjusting the loop point will also adjust the start point. This is the same as adjusting the third column of $\mathbf{Q}$ -Link knobs in the Q-Links panel.

Click the Lock button to turn Loop Lock on or off. When on, the loop point is the same as the start point. When off, the loop point is independent from the start point and indicated by a separate loop marker.

Click the Loop dropdown menu to select from the three loop modes:

Off: The sample will not loop.

Forward (Fwd): When the loop reaches its end point, it will start playing again from the loop point.

Alternating (Alt): When the loop reaches its end point, it will play in reverse. When it reaches the loop point again, it will start playing forward again from the loop point.

Reverse (Rev): When the loop reaches its end point, it will play in reverse. When it reaches the loop point again, it will return to the end point and continue playing in reverse.

Use the $\mathbf{X}$ -Fade field to apply a crossfade to a looping sample. See Addenda $>$ Updates in MPC 2.3 $>$ New Features $>$ Crossfade Looping for more information about this.

Use the Tune field to transpose the sample from its original pitch up to 24.00 semitones up or down.

Use the Root Nt field to set the root note of the sample. This defines which note will play the sample at its original pitch when in a keygroup program.

Click From BPM to tune a sample to the current sequence. In the Edit Tuning window that appears:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_152_268864.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_152_268864.jpg)

Use the Beats field to match the number of beats in the sequence.

To tune the sample to the sequence, click Match. The Tune field will adjust automatically and close the window. The sample is now tuned to the sequence.

To tune the sample to the sequence and adjust the sequence tempo, click To Sequence. This is the same as clicking Match but it also changes the sequence's tempo to the BPM shown in the Tempo field on the right.

To close the window, click Close.

Use the BPM field to enter a tempo manually. You can also click $\mathbf{{X2}}$ to double the value or $/2$ to halve it.

Click Detect BPM to automatically detect the tempo. In the Detect BPM window that appears:

---

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_152_618459.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_152_618459.jpg)

---

Use the BPM field to enter a tempo manually. You can also click $\mathbf{{X2}}$ to double the value or $/2$ to halve it.

Click Detect to detect the tempo automatically.

Click Tap Tempo at the bottom of the window at the desired rate to use it as the tempo. You can play a sequence in the background to help with your timing.

Click Close to close the window.

Note: Before detecting tempo, it is recommended that you Normalize samples for best results.

Use the Key field to set the root note of the sample and the Scale field to set whether the key is Major, Minor, or off (--).

Click Detect Key to automatically detect the sample key.

## Assigning Samples

You can assign your new sample directly to a pad from Trim Mode.

Click Assign to assign a sample. In the Assign Sample window that appears, you can click the Assign To menu to select a different assignment, and then click Do It to assign the sample or Cancel to close the window without assigning the sample.

Important: Assigning a sample to a pad in this way will replace the sample on the first layer of the pad.

If you set the Assign To menu to Assign slice to a pad, the pad will simply refer to the slice in this sample instead of creating a new sample. This is useful for reducing clutter in your project.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_153_887267.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_153_887267.jpg)

Use the Pad menu to select the desired pad. Alternatively, press the desired pad.

Use the Slice Type menu to select how the pad's layer settings will be set when the slice is assigned to it:

Non-Destructive Slice: The pad's Slice setting will be set to the slice number.

Pad Parameters: The pad's Slice setting will be set to Pad. The Pad Start and Pad End will be set to the slice's start point and end point values, and the Loop Position will be set to the slice's start point but with Pad Loop deactivated.

Use the Program menu to specify the program to which you want to add the slice.

If you set the Assign To menu to Make new sample, this will create a new sample in your project. (The original sample will remain as it is.)

---

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_153_692350.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_153_692350.jpg)

---

Use the Pad menu to select the desired pad. Alternatively, press the desired pad.

Select the Crop Sample box to delete the unused parts from the sample when it's created and assigned. This feature is destructive, though the project will still contain your original sample.

Leave this box deselected to keep the unused parts of the sample when it is created and assigned. This way, you will still be able to edit the entire sample further even though you are using only part of it at the moment.

Use the Program menu to specify the program to which you want to add the slice.

## Processing Slices & Samples

Use the column of Process buttons to select an editing process. In the Process Sample window that appears, you can click the Function menu to select a different process, and then click Do It to apply the process or Cancel to close the window without processing the sample.

You can use any of these functions as described below.

Note: All Slice processes will affect only the part of the sample between the start point and the end point. The Sample processes (Bit Reduce and Stereo $>$ Mono) will affect the entire sample regardless of its start point or end point.

The Create Stems process isolates different parts of the sample and separates them into new stem samples.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_154_213987.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_154_213987.jpg)

Click the icons to select or deselect from the following elements to create stems of:

- Vocals: Isolate vocal elements of the track into a stem.

- Bass: Isolate bass elements of the track into a stem.

- Drums: Isolate percussive elements of the track into a stem.

- Other: Isolate other musical textures, such as keys or guitars, into a stem.

Use the Program dropdown menu to select the program where the stems will be added.

The Assign to Pad function determines where the stem separated samples are added. When checked, you can select a pad in the chosen Program using the dropdown menu, and the stems will be added to the four layers of that pad. When unchecked, the stems will be added to the general project sample pool in the Project Info Browser.

Click the Use trimmed sample box to trim the source sample between the Start and End points before applying the stem separation process.

The Discard process deletes the regions before the start point and after the end point.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_154_387928.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_154_387928.jpg)

The Delete process deletes the region between the start point and end point and closes the gap between them.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_154_475964.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_154_475964.jpg)

The Silence process replaces the region between the start point and end point with silence.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_155_384734.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_155_384734.jpg)

The Extract process deletes the regions before the start point and after the end point and saves it as a new sample in your current project.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_155_166375.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_155_166375.jpg)

Use the Name field to name the new sample.

Tip: This is useful if you recorded a drum loop and wanted to remove just a snare drum hit, a kick drum hit, etc. to use separately in the project.

The Normalize process increases a sample's level to the highest level possible without distortion. This is essentially a kind of digital gain optimization, so you do not have to worry about excessive level settings when working with samples with a wide range of amplitudes.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_155_959450.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_155_959450.jpg)

The Reverse process reverses the region between the start point and end point.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_155_983680.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_155_983680.jpg)

The Fade In process sets a fade-in between the start point and end point. Click the Type menu to select a type of fade:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_155_276361.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_155_276361.jpg)

Linear fades the audio in with a linear curve-a straight line between the start and end.

Log fades the audio in with a logarithmic curve-quickly rising at the start and flattening out towards the end.

Exp fades the audio in with an exponential curve-slowly rising in the beginning and growing steeper towards the end.

The Fade Out process sets a fade-out between the start point and end point. Click the Type menu to select a type of fade:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_156_925189.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_156_925189.jpg)

Linear fades the audio out with a linear curve-a straight line between the start and end.

Log fades the audio out with a logarithmic curve-quickly rising at the start and flattening out towards the end.

Exp fades the audio out with an exponential curve-slowly rising in the beginning and growing steeper towards the end.

The Pitch Shift process changes the pitch of the sample without changing its length. This lets you set the sample's pitch to your sequence without affecting the sample's tempo or duration. Keep in mind that the audio quality may decrease at more extreme settings.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_156_949116.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_156_949116.jpg)

Use the Pitch field to shift the pitch up to 12.00 semitones up or down.

The Time Stretch process lengthens or shortens the sample without changing its pitch. This is useful for matching the durations of two samples with different pitches. You can enter the original tempo of the sample and the desired tempo after processing.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_156_929594.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_156_929594.jpg)

Use the Number of Beats field to set the desired value number of beats.

Use the New field to set the new tempo. The Ratio field will then automatically show the time stretch factor.

Alternatively, to adjust the ratio instead, use the Ratio field to set the desired ratio, and then the New field will change automatically based on the new time stretch factor.

The Gain Change process raises or lowers the volume of the sample.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_156_636939.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_156_636939.jpg)

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_156_834869.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_156_834869.jpg)

Use the Gain Amount field to adjust the gain up to $\mathbf{{18}}\mathbf{\;{dB}}$ up or down.

This function is different than Normalize because it will allow volumes beyond clipping level. This may be a desired effect, but remember to watch your output level!

The $\operatorname{\mathbf{C} \mathbf{o} \mathbf{p} \mathbf{y} }$ process saves a copy of the sample.

Use the Name field to name the new sample. Otherwise, the process will add a consecutive number after the sample name.

The Bit Reduce process lowers the bit resolution of a sample, effectively reducing its degree of faithful reproduction.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_157_624264.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_157_624264.jpg)

Use the Bit Depth field to set the bit depth from 1 bit to 16 bits.

The resulting sound is similar to the Resampler effect, but Bit Reduce will permanently alter the sample.

Tip: Use this on drum loops to get a dirty, "old-school" sizzle but with a digital "edge."

Note: This process affects the entire sample regardless of its start point or end point.

The Stereo $>$ Mono process converts a stereo sample to a new mono sample and saves it as a new sample.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_157_867519.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_157_867519.jpg)

Click the Source menu to select which channels will be converted:

- Left will convert the left channel only.

- Right will convert the right channel only.

- Sum will combine the left and right audio channels to a single mono channel.

Use the Name field to name the new sample. Otherwise, the process will add a consecutive number after the sample name.

Note: This process affects the entire sample regardless of its start point or end point.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_158_537106.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_158_537106.jpg)

While Trim Mode crops only the start and/or end off of a sample, Chop Mode divides the sample into multiple regions called slices. We recommend using Chop Mode when working with a long sample with different sounds throughout (e.g., a drum loop or a long melodic or harmonic passage).

To enter Chop Mode, click the Chop in the Q-Links panel.

To select a slice to edit, do one of the following:

- Click the lower half of the slice in the waveform in the upper half of the window.

- Click the corresponding pad in the Pads panel.

- Use Q-Link Knob 16.

- Adjust the Slice field in the Parameters panel.

## Q-Links

## In the $\mathbf{Q}$ -Links panel:

Use the first column of $\mathbf{Q}$ -Link knobs to adjust the start point. This is the same as adjusting the Start field in the Parameters panel.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_159_402613.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_159_402613.jpg)

Use the second column of $\mathbf{Q}$ -Link knobs to adjust the end point. This is the same as adjusting the End field in the Parameters panel.

Use Q-Link Knob 15 to adjust the cue playhead. This is the same as adjusting the Cue field in the Parameters panel.

Use Q-Link Knob 16 to select the desired slice. This is the same as adjusting the Slice field in the Parameters panel or clicking or pressing the corresponding pad.

Use Q-Link Knob 8 to scroll through the waveform in the large waveform display above.

Use Q-Link Knob 4 to zoom in or zoom out of the waveform.

When the Chop To menu is set to Regions, use Q-Link Knob 11 to set into how many regions the sample will be divided.

When the Chop To menu is set to Threshold, use Q-Link Knob 11 to set the threshold level.

For the first three columns, the top-most Q-Link knob provides coarse adjustment (x1000), while the bottom-most one knob provides fine adjustment (x1).

When Link Slices is enabled, changing the start point of a slice will also change the end point of the previous slice. Similarly, changing the end point of a slice will also change the start point of the next slice. Disable Link Slices if you are trying to create slices that use non-contiguous parts of the sample. This is the same as clicking the gear icon in the upper-right corner of the Wave Editor and using the Link Slices submenu.

Important: Link Slices must be disabled to make slices nonsequential, noncontiguous, or overlapping.

Enable Zero Snap to force start points, end points, and loop points to occur only at the waveform's "zero-crossings." This can help to avoid clicks and glitches when playing a sample. This is the same as clicking the gear icon in the upper-right corner of the Wave Editor and using the Zero Snap submenu.

Pads

The Pads panel enables you to play and select each slice of the selected sample:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_159_106567.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_159_106567.jpg)

Press the pad to play and select its corresponding the slice. If your sample has more than 16 slices, use the additional pad banks. This is the same as turning Q-Link Knob 16 in the Q-Links panel or using the Slice field in the Parameters panel.

Note: When the Pad Audition menu is set to One Shot, clicking or pressing the pad will play the slice from its start marker. When Pad Audition is set to Note On, clicking (or pressing) and then holding the pad will play the slice from its start marker - releasing the pad will stop playback.

## Parameters

The Parameters panel includes controls for editing the sample length and tuning as well as buttons for converting or assigning the sample (see this section) and processing the slice or sample (see this section).

Use the Chop To menu to choose how you want to use Chop Mode:

## Manual

This method lets you insert slices at locations you select.

## Threshold

This method uses an adjustable detection algorithm that derives the number of

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_160_745702.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_160_745702.jpg)

slices created from the volume levels present in the sample.

---

Use the Threshold field to set the threshold level. Alternatively, turn Q-Link Knob 11. The higher the selected value, the more slices will be created.

Use the Min Time field to set the minimum length of a slice in milliseconds.

## Regions

This method divides a sample into slices of equal length.

---

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_160_595399.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_160_595399.jpg)

---

Use the Num Regions field to set into how many regions the sample will be divided. Alternatively, turn Q-Link Knob 11. The higher the selected value, the more slices will be created.

## BPM

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_160_471690.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_160_471690.jpg)

---

This method divides a sample into slices based on the tempo (beats per minute).

Use the Bars field to set how many bars are in the sample. Alternatively, turn the second $\mathbf{Q}$ -Link knob in the third bank.

Use the Beats field to set how many beats are in each bar. Alternatively, turn the third $\mathbf{Q}$ -Link knob in the third bank.

Use the Time Div field to set a note division. Alternatively, turn the bottom-most Q-Link knob in the third bank. The slice markers will be placed according to this setting. You can select $1/\mathbf{4},\mathbf{1}/\mathbf{8},\mathbf{1}/\mathbf{{16}}$, or $\mathbf{1}/\mathbf{{32}}$ . (In most cases, you should set this parameter to $1/{16}$ .)

Use the Slice field to select the desired slice. This is the same as turning Q-Link Knob 16 field in the Q-Links panel or clicking or pressing the corresponding pad.

---

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_161_533250.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_161_533250.jpg)

---

Use the Start field to adjust the start point. This is the same as turning the first column of $\mathbf{Q}$ -Link knobs in the $\mathbf{Q}$ -Links panel.

Use the End field to adjust the end point. This is the same as turning the second column of $\mathbf{Q}$ -Link knobs in the $\mathbf{Q}$ -Links panel.

Note: When Link Slices is enabled, changing the start point of a slice will also change the end point of the previous slice. Similarly, changing the end point of a slice will also change the start point of the next slice. Disable Link Slices if you are trying to create slices that use non-contiguous parts of the sample.

Click +Slice (under the End field) to add a slice at the current playhead position. You can do this at any point during sample playback.

To insert a slice marker manually, click the upper part of the waveform at the desired location (the cursor will appear as a red arrow with a + symbol: $\downarrow +$ ).

To insert a slice marker during sample playback, press an unlit pad (usually Pad 1) to start playback of the sample, and then press an unlit pad during playback to place a slice marker at each location of the playhead. (If you press a lit pad, playback will restart from that pad's corresponding slice marker.) The number of the pad that is lit green is the number of the most-recently inserted slice marker. The numbers of the pads that are lit yellow are the numbers of the slice markers that are already inserted.

Click the - button (to the right of the Slice field) to combine the currently selected slice with the one before it.

Click the + button (to the right of the Slice field) to split the currently selected slice into two slices of the same size.

Click -All (to the right of the Slice field) to remove all slices from a sample.

The cue playhead is useful when manually inserting slice markers. You can set its position and behavior to suit your workflow.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_161_112930.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_161_112930.jpg)

Use the Cue field (below the $\mathbf{{Start}}$ field) to adjust the position of the cue playhead. Alternatively, click and drag the white marker with the triangle $\left( \mathbf{\nabla }\right)$ in the timeline.

Click $>$ Play to play the sample from the cue playhead.

Click +Slice to create a slice marker at the cue playhead position.

Click the Cue Audition menu to select how the audio plays from the cue playhead:

One Shot: Clicking >Play will play the entire sample from the cue playhead.

Toggle: Clicking >Play once will start playback from cue playhead. Clicking it once more will stop playback.

Click the Pad Audition menu to select how each slice plays from each start marker when you press the corresponding pad:

One Shot: Clicking or pressing the $\mathbf{{pad}}$ will play the slice from its start marker.

Note On: Clicking (or pressing) and then holding the pad will play the slice from its start marker. Releasing the pad will stop playback.

Converting or Assigning Slices

In Chop Mode, you can assign your new sample directly to a pad or convert the new sample into a new program or patched phrase.

Use the buttons in the Non-Destructive Convert and Extract New Samples sections to select a conversion and assignment process. In the Convert or Assign Slices window that appears, you can click the Convert To menu to select a different process, and then click Do It to apply the process or Close to close the window without processing the sample.

If you set the Convert To menu to New [program type] program using slices, this will create a new program and assign the sample's slices to its pads. The pads will simply refer to the slices in this sample instead of creating new samples. This is useful for reducing clutter in your project. The new program will be named after the sample and appended with ch.

Convert or Assign Slices

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_162_874247.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_162_874247.jpg)

Use the Slice Type menu to select how each pad's layer settings will be set when the slices are assigned to them (see Program Edit Mode to learn more about the parameters mentioned below):

Non-Destructive Slice: Each pad's Slice setting will be set to the slice number.

Pad Parameters: Each pad's Slice setting will be set to Pad. The Pad Start and Pad End parameters will be set to the slice's start point and end point values, and the Loop Pos parameter will be set to the slice's start point but with Pad Loop deactivated.

Select the Create Events box to automatically create a new track for the new program in which each pad plays its corresponding slice in ascending sequence by pad number.

If Create Events is selected, use the Bars field to set how many bars the slices' events will occupy.

If you set the Convert To menu to New clip program, this will create a new clip program and assign the sample's slices to its pads as clips. The pads will simply refer to the slices in this sample instead of creating new samples. This is useful for reducing clutter in your project. The new program will be named after the sample and appended with ch.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_162_489468.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_162_489468.jpg)

Use the Tempo field to enter the tempo of the clips in the new program.

Select the Create Events box to automatically create a new track for the new program in which each pad plays its corresponding slice in ascending sequence by pad number.

If Create Events is selected, use the Number of Bars field to set how many bars the slices' events will occupy.

If you set the Convert To menu to New program with new samples, this will create a new sample from each slice and assign them to pads in a new program.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_163_328371.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_163_328371.jpg)

The new program will be named after the sample and appended with ch. The new samples will be appended with SI-# (where # is a consecutive number).

Select the Crop Samples box to delete the unused parts from the sample when they are created and assigned. This feature is destructive, though the project will still contain your original sample.

Leave this box deselected to keep the unused parts of the samples when they're created and assigned. This way, you will still be able to edit the entire samples further even though you are using only part of them at the moment.

By default, this option already will create a new program. You can deselect the Create New Program box to convert each slice into a sample that is placed in the project's sample pool but not assigned to a program or pad.

If Create New Program is selected, select the Create Events box to automatically create a new track in which each pad plays its corresponding slice in ascending sequence by pad number.

If Create Events is selected, use the Number of Bars field to set how many bars the slices' events will occupy.

If you set the Convert To menu to Assign slice to a pad, the pad will simply refer to the slice in this sample instead of creating a new sample. This is useful for reducing clutter in your project.

Convert or Assign Slices

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_163_256627.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_163_256627.jpg)

Important: Assigning a sample to a pad in this way will replace the sample on the first layer of the pad.

Use the Pad menu to select the desired pad. Alternatively, press the desired pad.

Use the Slice Type menu to select how the pad's layer settings will be set when the slice is assigned to it (see Program Edit Mode to learn more about the parameters mentioned below):

Non-Destructive Slice: The pad's Slice setting will be set to the slice number.

Pad Parameters: The pad's Slice setting will be set to Pad. The Pad Start and Pad End will be set to the slice's start point and end point values, and the Loop Position will be set to the slice's start point but with Pad Loop deactivated.

Use the Program menu to specify the program to which you want to add the slice.

If you set the Convert To menu to New Sample to Pad, this will create a new sample in your project. (The original sample will remain as it is.)

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_164_951895.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_164_951895.jpg)

Important: Assigning a sample to a pad in this way will replace the sample on the first layer of the pad.

Use the Pad menu to select the desired pad. Alternatively, press the desired pad.

Select the Crop Sample box to delete the unused parts from the sample when it's created and assigned. This feature is destructive, though the project will still contain your original sample.

Leave this box deselected to keep the unused parts of the sample when it is created and assigned. This way, you will still be able to edit the entire sample further even though you are using only part of it at the moment.

Use the Program menu to specify the program to which you want to add the slice.

If you set the Convert To menu to Patched phrase, this will create a new sample that will play based on the tempo of your Sequence, and places it in the current project. The patched phrase will have the same name as the original sample but appended with $\mathbf{{pp}}$ and will use a different icon when viewing your project information.

Convert or Assign Slices

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_164_625737.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_164_625737.jpg)

Use the Bars field to set how many bars long the patched phrase is meant to be.

## Processing Slices

Use the column of Process buttons to select an editing process. In the Process Sample window that appears, you can click the Function menu to select a different process, and then click Do It to apply the process or Cancel to close the window without processing the sample.

You can use any of these functions as described below.

Important: Chop Mode is non-destructive: You can choose the slice/edit behavior without destroying your original sample, giving you more control over sample playback; you can save your sliced sample and but also reuse all of the slice data in another project.

The Create Stems process isolates different parts of the sample and separates them into new stem samples.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_165_760608.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_165_760608.jpg)

Click the icons to select or deselect from the following elements to create stems of:

- Vocals: Isolate vocal elements of the track into a stem.

- Bass: Isolate bass elements of the track into a stem.

- Drums: Isolate percussive elements of the track into a stem.

- Other: Isolate other musical textures, such as keys or guitars, into a stem.

Use the Program dropdown menu to select the program where the stems will be added.

The Assign to Pad function determines where the stem separated samples are added. When checked, you can select a pad in the chosen Program using the dropdown menu, and the stems will be added to the four layers of that pad. When unchecked, the stems will be added to the general project sample pool in the Project Info Browser.

Click the Use trimmed sample box to trim the source sample between the Start and End points before applying the stem separation process.

The Silence process replaces the region between the start point and end point with silence.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_165_792235.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_165_792235.jpg)

The Extract process deletes the regions before the start point and after the end point and saves it as a new sample in your current project.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_165_933654.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_165_933654.jpg)

Use the Name field to name the new sample.

Tip: This is useful if you recorded a drum loop and wanted to remove just a snare drum hit, a kick drum hit, etc. to use separately in the project.

The Normalize process increases a sample's level to the highest level possible without distortion. This is essentially a kind of digital gain optimization, so you do not have to worry about excessive level settings when working with samples with a wide range of amplitudes.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_166_871644.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_166_871644.jpg)

The Reverse process reverses the region between the start point and end point.

Process Sample

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_166_890839.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_166_890839.jpg)

The Fade In process sets a fade-in between the start point and end point. Click the Type menu to select a type of fade:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_166_275278.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_166_275278.jpg)

Linear fades the audio in with a linear curve-a straight line between the start and end.

Log fades the audio in with a logarithmic curve-quickly rising at the start and flattening out towards the end.

Exp fades the audio in with an exponential curve-slowly rising in the beginning and growing steeper towards the end.

The Fade Out process sets a fade-out between the start point and end point. Click the Type menu to select a type of fade:

Process Sample

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_166_650388.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_166_650388.jpg)

Linear fades the audio out with a linear curve-a straight line between the start and end.

Log fades the audio out with a logarithmic curve-quickly rising at the start and flattening out towards the end.

Exp fades the audio out with an exponential curve-slowly rising in the beginning and growing steeper towards the end.

The Pitch Shift process changes the pitch of the sample without changing its length. This lets you set the sample's pitch to your sequence without affecting the sample's tempo or duration. Keep in mind that the audio quality may decrease at more extreme settings.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_166_929709.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_166_929709.jpg)

Use the Pitch field to shift the pitch up to 12.00 semitones up or down.

The Gain Change process raises or lowers the volume of the sample.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_167_925959.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_167_925959.jpg)

Use the Gain Amount field to adjust the gain up to 18 dB up or down.

This function is different than Normalize because it will allow volumes beyond clipping level. This may be a desired effect, but remember to watch your output level! Program Mode

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_168_887673.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_168_887673.jpg)

Program Mode lets you edit a sample in the context of the program in which you will use it. You can adjust the pad parameters as though you were in Program Edit Mode, auditioning and hearing how it will sound in the program's audio path.

To enter Program Mode, click Program in the Q-Links panel.

## Q-Links

In the $\mathbf{Q}$ -Links panel:

Use the first column of $\mathbf{Q}$ -Link knobs to adjust the start point. This is the same as adjusting the Start field in the Parameters panel.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_168_194172.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_168_194172.jpg)

Use the second column of $\mathbf{Q}$ -Link knobs to adjust the end point. This is the same as adjusting the End field in the Parameters panel.

Use the third column of Q-Link knobs to adjust the loop point if Loop Lock is off. If Loop Lock is on, adjusting the loop point will also adjust the start point. This is the same as adjusting the Loop field in the Parameters panel.

Use Q-Link Knob 16 to display either the sample as it has been edited (Pad) or the entire sample (All). This is the same as adjusting the Slice field in the Parameters panel.

Use Q-Link Knob 8 to scroll through the waveform in the large waveform display above.

Use Q-Link Knob 4 to zoom in or zoom out of the waveform.

For the first three columns, the top-most Q-Link knob provides coarse adjustment (x1000), while the bottom-most one knob provides fine adjustment (x1).

When Link Slices is enabled (after you have created slices in Chop Mode), changing the start point of a slice will also change the end point of the previous slice. Similarly, changing the end point of a slice will also change the start point of the next slice. Disable Link Slices if you are trying to create slices that use non-contiguous parts of the sample. This is the same as clicking the gear icon in the upper-right corner of the Wave Editor and using the Link Slices submenu.

Important: Link Slices must be disabled to make slices nonsequential, noncontiguous, or overlapping.

Enable Zero Snap to force start points, end points, and loop points to occur only at the waveform's "zero-crossings." This can help to avoid clicks and glitches when playing a sample. This is the same as clicking the gear icon in the upper-right corner of the Wave Editor and using the Zero Snap submenu.

## Pads

The Pads panel shows their assigned samples in the current program.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_169_100810.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_169_100810.jpg)

Click each pad to hear its sample/samples. The sample on its first layer will automatically appear in the waveform display for editing.

## Parameters

The Parameters panel includes controls for editing the sample length and tuning as well as buttons for assigning the sample (see this section) and processing the slice or sample (see this section).

Use the Slice field to display either the sample as it has been edited (Pad) or the entire sample (AII). This is the same as adjusting Q-Link Knob 16 in the Q-Links panel.

If the Slice field is set to All, you can display the sample as it has been edited but keep the start point and end point by clicking To Pad. The Slice field will change to $\mathbf{{Pad}}$, but the start point and end point will remain in their current locations.

Use the Start field to adjust the start point. This is the same as adjusting the first column of Q-Link knobs in the Q-Links panel.

Use the End field to adjust the end point. This is the same as adjusting the second column of Q-Link knobs in the Q-Links panel.

Use the Loop field to adjust the loop point if Loop Lock is off. If Loop Lock is on, adjusting the loop point will also adjust the start point. This is the same as adjusting the third column of $\mathbf{Q}$ -Link knobs in the $\mathbf{Q}$ -Links panel.

Click the Lock button to turn Loop Lock on or off. When $\mathbf{o}\mathbf{n}$ , the loop point is the same as the start point. When $\mathbf{o}\mathbf{{ff}}$ , the loop point is independent from the start point and indicated by a separate loop marker.

Click the Loop menu to cycle between the three loop modes:

Off: The sample will not loop.

Forward (Fwd): When the loop reaches its end point, it will start playing again from the loop point.

Reverse (Rev): When the loop reaches its end point, it will play in reverse. When it reaches the loop point again, it will return to the end point and continue playing in reverse.

Alternating (Alt): When the loop reaches its end point, it will play in reverse. When it reaches the loop point again, it will start playing forward again from the loop point.

Use the Crossfade field to apply a crossfade to a looping sample. See Addenda > Updates in MPC 2.3 > New Features > Crossfade Looping for more information about this.

Use the $\mathsf{{Tune}}$ field to transpose the sample from its original pitch up to $\mathbf{{24.00}}$ semitones up or down.

Use the Root Nt field to set the root note of the sample. This defines which note will play the sample at its original pitch when in a keygroup program.

Click From BPM to tune a sample to the current sequence. In the Edit Tuning window that appears:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_170_508448.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_170_508448.jpg)

Use the Beats field to match the number of beats in the sequence.

To tune the sample to the sequence, click Match. The Tune field will adjust automatically and close the window. The sample is now tuned to the sequence.

To tune the sample to the sequence and adjust the sequence tempo, click To Sequence. This is the same as clicking Match but it also changes the sequence's tempo to the BPM shown in the Tempo field on the right.

To close the window, click Close.

Use the BPM field to enter a tempo manually. You can also click $\mathbf{{X2}}$ to double the value or $/2$ to halve it.

## Click Detect BPM to automatically detect the tempo. In the Detect BPM window that appears:

---

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_170_150720.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_170_150720.jpg)

---

Use the BPM field to enter a tempo manually. You can also click $\mathbf{{X2}}$ to double the value or $/2$ to halve it.

Click Detect to detect the tempo automatically.

Click Tap Tempo at the bottom of the window at the desired rate to use it as the tempo. You can play a sequence in the background to help with your timing.

Click Close to close the window.

Note: Before detecting tempo, it is recommended that you Normalize samples for best results.

## Assigning Samples

You can assign your new sample directly to a pad from Program Mode.

Click Assign to assign a sample. In the Assign Sample window that appears, you can click the Assign To menu to select a different assignment, and then click Do It to assign the sample or Cancel to close the window without assigning the sample.

Important: Assigning a sample to a pad in this way will replace the sample on the first layer of the pad.

If you set the Assign To menu to Assign slice to a pad, the pad will simply refer to the slice in this sample instead of creating a new sample. This is useful for reducing clutter in your project.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_171_877198.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_171_877198.jpg)

Use the Pad menu to select the desired pad. Alternatively, press the desired pad.

Use the Slice Type menu to select how the pad's layer settings will be set when the slice is assigned to it:

Non-Destructive Slice: The pad's Slice setting will be set to the slice number.

Pad Parameters: The pad's Slice setting will be set to Pad. The Pad Start and Pad End will be set to the slice's start point and end point values, and the Loop Position will be set to the slice's start point but with Pad Loop deactivated.

Use the Program menu to specify the program to which you want to add the slice.

If you set the Assign To menu to Make new sample, this will create a new sample in your project. (The original sample will remain as it is.)

---

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_171_335365.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_171_335365.jpg)

---

Use the Pad menu to select the desired pad. Alternatively, press the desired pad.

Select the Crop Sample box to delete the unused parts from the sample when it's created and assigned. This feature is destructive, though the project will still contain your original sample.

Leave this box deselected to keep the unused parts of the sample when it is created and assigned. This way, you will still be able to edit the entire sample further even though you are using only part of it at the moment.

Use the Program menu to specify the program to which you want to add the slice.

## Processing Slices

Use the column of Process buttons to select an editing process. In the Process Sample window that appears, you can click the Function menu to select a different process, and then click Do It to apply the process or Cancel to close the window without processing the sample.

You can use any of these functions as described below.

Important: Program Mode is non-destructive: You can choose the slice/edit behavior without destroying your original sample, giving you more control over sample playback; you can save your sliced sample and but also reuse all of the slice data in another project. See the Program Edit Mode chapter to learn more about setting a pad to play the entire sample, a specific slice of a sample, or a specific region of the sample (independent of its slice markers).

The Create Stems process isolates different parts of the sample and separates them into new stem samples.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_172_550677.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_172_550677.jpg)

Click the icons to select or deselect from the following elements to create stems of:

- Vocals: Isolate vocal elements of the track into a stem.

- Bass: Isolate bass elements of the track into a stem.

- Drums: Isolate percussive elements of the track into a stem.

- Other: Isolate other musical textures, such as keys or guitars, into a stem.

Use the Program dropdown menu to select the program where the stems will be added.

The Assign to Pad function determines where the stem separated samples are added. When checked, you can select a pad in the chosen Program using the dropdown menu, and the stems will be added to the four layers of that pad. When unchecked, the stems will be added to the general project sample pool in the Project Info Browser.

Click the Use trimmed sample box to trim the source sample between the Start and End points before applying the stem separation process.

The Silence process replaces the region between the start point and end point with silence.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_172_254945.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_172_254945.jpg)

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_172_439131.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_172_439131.jpg)

The Extract process deletes the regions before the start point and after the end point and saves it as a new sample in your current project.

Use the Name field to name the new sample.

Tip: This is useful if you recorded a drum loop and wanted to remove just a snare drum hit, a kick drum hit, etc. to use separately in the project.

The Normalize process increases a sample's level to the highest level possible without distortion. This is essentially a kind of digital gain optimization, so you do not have to worry about excessive level settings when working with samples with a wide range of amplitudes.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_173_719878.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_173_719878.jpg)

The Reverse process reverses the region between the start point and end point.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_173_994466.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_173_994466.jpg)

Log fades the audio out with a logarithmic curve-quickly rising at the start and flattening out towards the end.

Exp fades the audio out with an exponential curve-slowly rising in the beginning and growing steeper towards the end.

The Pitch Shift process changes the pitch of the sample without changing its length. This lets you set the sample's pitch to your sequence without affecting the sample's tempo or duration. Keep in mind that the audio quality may decrease at more extreme settings.

Process Sample

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_173_435789.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_173_435789.jpg)

Use the Pitch field to shift the pitch up to 12.00 semitones up or down.

The Gain Change process raises or lowers the volume of the sample.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_174_794712.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_174_794712.jpg)

Use the Gain Amount field to adjust the gain up to 18 dB up or down.

This function is different than Normalize because it will allow volumes beyond clipping level. This may be a desired effect, but remember to watch your output level!

Use each $\mathbf{Q}$ -Link knob to adjust the velocity (1-127) of its corresponding step. Setting a value of $\mathbf{O}\left( \mathbf{{Off}}\right)$ will delete the note event from that step. Changing a velocity from $\mathbf{O}\left( \mathbf{{Off}}\right)$ to a value of $\mathbf{1}$ or greater will enter a note event at that step.

Pads

The Pads panel lets you quickly create and delete note events as "steps" by using the pads of your MPC hardware or MPC software, similar to step recording with drum machines in the 1980s.

<table><thead><tr><th>BAR</th><th>1</th><th>PAD SELECT</th><th>PAD</th><th>A01</th></tr></thead></table>

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_186_675824.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_186_675824.jpg)

Each pad represents a step in the bar. Keep in mind that the total number of steps depends on the Time Correct setting. For time divisions larger than 16 (e.g., 32), the bar's steps will be represented by multiple pad banks. In that case, use the Pad field to view all the steps within a bar.

Use the Bar field or the arrows ( $\blacktriangleleft$ or $\blacktriangleright$ ) on either side of it to select the bar whose steps you want to edit.

Use the Pad Select button to select the pad whose steps you want to edit. Click Pad Select to activate it, click a pad (the currently selected pad is lit green), and then click Pad Select again to deactivate it.

Alternatively, click and drag the Pad field up or down. You can also click a pad in the Grid Editor.

Click an unlit pad to enter a note event at that step. The pad will light up with a color corresponding to its velocity.

Click a lit pad to delete the note event from that step. The pad will be unlit.

The green pad indicates the current step (playhead position) in the sequence.

0 The Sampler lets you record audio samples to use in your projects. Important: To record any audio, you need to connect an audio source to your MPC hardware or to your computer's audio interface.

To open the Sampler, do any of the following:

- Click the vinyl icon in the toolbar (if shown).

- Click the down arrow ( $\mathbf{\nabla }$ ) next to the other mode icons in the toolbar, and click Sampler.

- Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, and go to View $>$ Mode and click Sampler.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_187_919450.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_187_919450.jpg)

## To set up the Sampler before recording:

1. Make sure to reduce the volume levels of your audio source and speakers, headphones, and/or monitors before you make any connections to avoid "pops" or feedback.

2. Connect a synthesizer or other line-level audio source to the input/inputs of your MPC hardware or external audio interface.

3. On your MPC hardware or external audio interface, turn the Rec Vol knob to set the input level while playing your audio source. You should now see the level in the meter. Make sure it does not exceed the maximum level (the meter should not be "peaking" constantly).

4. Set the recording controls as desired (described in this chapter).

5. Click the Arm button to record-arm the Sampler.

The upper half of the window shows the waveform. Unlike other times the waveform is shown here, you cannot edit the waveform in this part of the window; you must use the Wave Editor in Main Mode or Sample Edit Mode instead.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_188_748764.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_188_748764.jpg)

The timeline provides a reference for the length of the sample. Click the down arrow $\left( \nabla \right)$ or right-click anywhere on the timeline to select the increments it will use: Time (secs:ms), Samples, or Beats.

Scroll left or right on the waveform to move through it. Use the sliders in the lower-right corner or click the timeline and drag down or up to zoom in or out.

The lower half of the window can display the Q-Links panel, Pads panel, Sampler panel, and Project panel. Click the corresponding selector to show or hide each one. See General Features $>$ Panels $>$ Project to learn more about the Project panel.

The Pads panel varies based on the four different recording methods: Sample, Slice, Pad Tap, or Pad Hold, all described in this chapter.

## Q-Links

Use Q-Link Knob 1 to adjust the threshold. This is the same as adjusting the threshold slider in the Sampler panel.

Use Q-Link Knobs 3 and 4 to define the maximum sampling time. This is the same as adjusting the Max Length field as shown on your MPC hardware. You can record up to 19 minutes and 59 seconds (19:59) per sample. We recommend setting these to values that roughly match your estimated recording duration.

## Pads

The Pads panel has three different appearances, depending on the recording method:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_189_141022.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_189_141022.jpg)

While using the Sample Method, the Pads panel shows information for each pad, depending on the currently selected program. This is identical to how the Pads panel appears in Main Mode (see the Main Mode chapter to learn more).

While using the Slice Method, the pads correspond to slices of the currently recorded sample. See Recording Methods $>$ Slice to learn how to use the Pads panel with this method.

While using the Pad Tap or Pad Hold Methods, clicking a pad or clicking and holding a pad immediately starts or continues recording directly to that pad. See Recording Methods $>$ Pad Tap or Pad Hold to learn how to use the Pads panel with those methods.

## Sampler

The Input Source menu in the upper-left corner of the Sampler panel defines whether you are going to record an external audio signal (Stereo or Mono) or an internal signal from within the MPC software (Resample L, Resample R, or Resample L+R).

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_190_226173.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_190_226173.jpg)

Resampling does not require an audio connection because the source is within the MPC software and is therefore recorded without any loss in audio quality. You can, for example, use Resample to record two or more samples by pressing the corresponding pads simultaneously or by simply playing a sequence.

The Inserts slots show any enabled or disabled effects for the Sampler. See General Features $>$ Effects $>$ Insert Effects to learn more about insert effects.

Important: These effects are applied to the audio as you record it. This means that the effects cannot be "removed" from the sound later.

Click the Mono/Stereo menu to choose whether your recorded samples will be monaural (Mono) or binaural (Stereo).

Click the Monitor button to set how the Sampler will be monitored:

When set to $\ln$, the audio you hear in your headphones will be taken before it reaches the Sampler, ensuring zero latency.

When off, the audio you hear in your headphones will be taken after it is processed in the Sampler, so there may be some latency, but you will hear the audio source as it sounds in the recording.

Tip: To avoid possible clicks or feedback while input monitoring, reduce the level of the audio sources.

Use the threshold slider to adjust the threshold. Alternatively, turn Q-Link Knob 1.

When the Sampler is record-armed, it automatically starts recording when the level of the incoming source exceeds this setting. If you set it too high, the recording may not start when you play the input source, or the start of the material you wanted to record may be missing. If you set it too low, the recording may start too early, before you play the external source. Set this parameter to an appropriate level using the level meter.

For reference, the $\mathbf{S}$ ample $\mathbf{L}$ ength counter shows you the length of your sample during the recording procedure.

Click Arm to record-arm the Sampler. The button will then change to Record.

At that point, start recording by doing either of the following:

- Start performing so that the incoming audio level exceeds the level of the threshold slider.

- Click the Record button under the Sample Length counter.

Click the Record Method menu to select the recording method you want to use: Sample, Slice, Pad Tap, or Pad Hold, all described in the following section.

Click Add Slice as the sample records to insert a slice marker in a sample while recording. Each time you press it, a slice marker will be placed at that location.

## Recording Methods

## Sample

Using this method, you can insert slice markers directly in your sample as you record it.

Slice markers divide the sample into multiple regions called slices, which you can adjust in the Chop Mode of Sample Edit Mode (see Sample Edit Mode $>$ Chop Mode for more information). This is useful when working with a long sample with different sounds throughout (e.g., a drum loop or a long melodic or harmonic passage).

To start recording, do one of the following:

- Start performing so that the incoming audio level exceeds the level of the threshold slider.

- Click the Record button under the Sample Length counter.

To insert a slice marker in a sample while recording, click Add Slice as the sample records. Each time you press it, a slice marker will be placed at that location.

## To stop recording, click the Stop button under the Sample Length counter.

## After you stop your recording, the Keep or Discard Sample window will appear.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_191_418113.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_191_418113.jpg)

Use the New Name field to name the new sample. Otherwise, the process will add a consecutive number after the sample name.

Click the Program menu to assign the new sample to a drum program. Select <none> if you want to save it to the project without assigning it to a program.

Use the Assign to Pad field to assign the sample to a pad in the selected drum program.

Use the Root Note field to set where the sample's original pitch will be on the keyboard.

If you recorded a sample while a sequence was playing, the Keep or Discard Sample window will show a few more options after you select a pad.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_191_566159.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_191_566159.jpg)

Check the Add Event box to automatically add the sample to the currently playing sequence.

Use the At menu to select where you want the event to start:

Start: The sample will be a note event at the start of the currently playing sequence.

Trigger: The sample will be a note event where you began recording it in the currently playing sequence.

Use the Track field to set which track will contain the new event.

To save the recording, click Save.

To play the recording, click Play.

To discard the recording and close the window, click Discard.

To confirm your selections, click Keep.

To edit the recording in Sample Edit Mode (recommended), click Edit.

Slice

Using this method, the pads correspond to slices of the currently recorded sample. Slice markers divide the sample into multiple regions called slices, which you can adjust in the Chop Mode of Sample Edit Mode (see Sample Edit Mode > Chop Mode for more information). This is useful when working with a long sample with different sounds throughout (e.g., a drum loop or a long melodic or harmonic passage).

To start recording, do one of the following:

- Start performing so that the incoming audio level exceeds the level of the threshold slider.

- Click the Record button under the Sample Length counter.

To insert a slice marker in a sample while recording, press any pad as the sample records. Each time you press it, a slice marker will be placed at that location.

The number of the pad that flashes $\mathbf{{red}}$ is the number of the slice marker that will be inserted next. The numbers of the pads that are lit yellow are the numbers of the slice markers that are already inserted.

When you are done recording, you can name the sample and create a new program using the slices.

To stop recording, click the Stop button under the Sample Length counter.

## After you stop your recording, the Keep or Discard Sample window will appear.

Use the New Name field to name the new sample. Otherwise, the process will add a consecutive number after the sample name.

Click the Create New Program menu to assign the new sample to a new program:

Off: No program will be created. The slices will still be added to your project's sample pool.

With Non-Destructive Slices: In the new program, each pad's Slice setting will be set to the corresponding slice number. This is identical to how you can assign samples in Sample Edit Mode (as described in Sample Edit Mode > Chop Mode).

With Pad Parameters: In the new program, each pad's Slice setting will be set to Pad. The Pad Start and Pad End will be set to the slice's start point and end point values, and the Loop Position will be set to the slice's start point but with Pad Loop deactivated. This is identical to how you can assign samples in Sample Edit Mode (as described in Sample Edit Mode $>$ Chop Mode).

To save the recording, click Save.

To play the recording, click Play.

To discard the recording and return to the Sampler, click Discard.

To confirm your selections, click Keep.

To edit the recording in Sample Edit Mode (recommended), click Edit.

Pad Tap

Important: This mode works for drum programs only; you must select a drum program before using this mode. Otherwise, this feature will not do anything, even though it may appear to work.

With this method, clicking or pressing a pad immediately starts or continues recording directly to that pad (make sure you are using the desired program before you start recording). Pads with assigned samples are lit bright yellow. Pads without samples are lit dim yellow.

To start recording to a pad, click or press it. Recording will start immediately, and the pad will flash red. If you click or press a new pad, the recording will stop on the previous pad, which will turn green, and start on the new pad, which will flash red.

Note: If you start recording by clicking Record under the Sample Length counter-or if the volume exceeds the level of the threshold slider-the sample will record to your project's sample pool, not to a pad.

To stop recording to a pad, click or press the currently recording pad, which is flashing red. The sample will continue recording. You can start recording on another pad at any time.

To stop all recording, click the Stop button under the Sample Length counter.

When you are done recording, each pad that you have clicked or pressed during recording:

- will have its Slice setting set to Pad;

- will have its Pad Start and Pad End set to the slice's start point and end point values; and

- will have its Loop Position set to the slice's start point but with Pad Loop deactivated.

This is identical to how you can assign samples in Sample Edit Mode (described in Sample Edit Mode > Chop Mode). Tip: We recommend editing your recorded sample in Sample Edit Mode (see Sample Edit Mode for more information).

## Pad Hold

Important: This mode works for drum programs only; you must select a drum program before using this mode. Otherwise, this feature will not do anything, even though it may appear to work.

With this method, clicking or pressing and holding a pad immediately starts or continues recording directly to that pad (make sure you are using the desired program before you start recording). Pads with assigned samples are lit bright yellow. Pads without samples are lit dim yellow.

To start recording to a pad, click and hold it, or press and hold it. Recording will start immediately, and the pad will light red.

Note: If you start recording by clicking Record under the Sample Length counter-or if the volume exceeds the level of the threshold slider-the sample will record to your project's sample pool, not to a pad.

To stop recording, release the $\mathbf{p}$ ad. The pad will light green, and the sample will continue recording. You can start recording on another pad at any time.

To stop all recording, click the Stop button under the Sample Length counter.

When you are done recording, each pad that you have clicked or pressed during recording:

- will have its Slice setting set to Pad;

- will have its Pad Start and Pad End set to the slice's start point and end point values; and

- will have its Loop Position set to the slice's start point but with Pad Loop deactivated.

This is identical to how you can assign samples in Sample Edit Mode (described in Sample Edit Mode > Chop Mode).

Tip: We recommend editing your recorded sample in Sample Edit Mode (see Sample Edit Mode for more information).

The Looper lets you record and overdub audio in real time-a great tool for live performance as well as spontaneous moments in the studio. You can export the loop as a sample to use in your project.

To open the Looper, do any of the following:

- Click the loop-and-waveform icon in the toolbar (if shown).

- Click the down arrow $\left( \nabla \right)$ next to the other mode icons in the toolbar, and click Looper.

- Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, and go to View $>$ Mode and click Looper.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_194_258282.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_194_258282.jpg)

Below is a brief step-by-step process so you can get started quickly. Continue reading the rest of this chapter to learn how to use the Looper in different cases.

## To get started using the Looper:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_195_186723.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_195_186723.jpg)

1. Make sure to reduce the volume levels of your audio source and speakers/headphones/monitors before you make any connections to avoid "pops" or feedback.

2. Connect a synthesizer, audio player, etc. to the input/inputs of your MPC hardware or external audio interface.

3. On your MPC hardware or external audio interface, turn the Rec Vol knob to set the input level while playing your audio source. You should now see the level in the meter in the Looper panel. Make sure it does not exceed the maximum level (the meter should not be "peaking" constantly).

4. In the Looper panel, set the recording controls as desired (described later in this chapter).

5. Click the Record To menu in the Looper panel and select Overdub.

6. Click the Ovr ( $\oplus$ ) button in the Looper panel to record-arm the Looper.

7. Play your audio source. The Looper will start recording immediately when the input level reaches the threshold value. Alternatively, click Play (I) in the Looper panel to manually start recording.

Each time the Looper repeats, its contents are being overdubbed-a new layer of audio will be added each time you let the Looper repeat as it records.

Tip: You can record a loop while playing a sequence in the background for reference.

8. To stop recording, click Play $\left( \blacktriangleright \right)$ in the Looper panel.

To export your loop as a sample, click Export to open the Export Loop as Sample window.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_195_103328.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_195_103328.jpg)

To clear the contents of the Looper, click Clear.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_196_809360.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_196_809360.jpg)

The upper half of the window shows the real-time waveform of the Looper’s audio. Unlike other times the waveform is shown here, you cannot edit the waveform in this part of the window.

The audio playhead indicates the Looper’s current playback and/or recording position.

The timeline provides a reference for the length of the sample as bars.beats.ticks.

The lower half of the window can display the $\mathbf{Q}$ -Links panel, Pads panel, Looper panel, and Project panel. Click the corresponding selector to show or hide each one.

The Pads panel shows information for each pad, depending on the currently selected program. This is identical to how the Pads panel appears in Main Mode (see the Main Mode chapter to learn more).

See General Features > Panels > Project to learn more about the Project panel.

The Q-Links panel and Looper panel are described in the following sections.

Use Q-Link Knob 1 to adjust the threshold. This is the same as adjusting the threshold slider in the Looper panel.

Use Q-Link Knob 4 to adjust the Looper's output gain level. This is the same as adjusting the Output Gain slider in the Looper panel.

## Looper

The Input Source menu in the upper-left corner of the Looper panel defines whether you are going to record an external audio signal (Stereo or Mono) or an internal signal from within the MPC software (Resample L, Resample R, or Resample L+R).

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_197_514313.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_197_514313.jpg)

Resampling does not require an audio connection because the source is within the MPC software and is therefore recorded without any loss in audio quality. You can, for example, use Resample to record two or more samples by pressing the corresponding pads simultaneously or by simply playing a sequence.

The Inserts slots show any enabled or disabled effects for the Looper. See General Features $>$ Effects $>$ Insert Effects to learn more about insert effects.

Important: These effects are applied to the audio as you record it. This means that the effects cannot be "removed" from the sound later.

Click the Mono/Stereo menu to choose whether your recorded loop will be monaural (Mono) or binaural (Stereo).

Click the Monitor button to set how the Looper will be monitored:

When set to $\ln$, the audio you hear in your headphones will be taken before it reaches the Sampler, ensuring zero latency.

When off, the audio you hear in your headphones will be taken after it is processed in the Sampler, so there may be some latency, but you will hear the audio source as it sounds in the recording.

Tip: To avoid possible clicks or feedback while input monitoring, reduce the level of the audio sources.

Use the threshold slider to adjust the threshold. Alternatively, turn Q-Link Knob 1.

When the Looper is record-armed, it automatically starts recording when the level of the incoming source exceeds this setting. If you set it too high, the recording may not start when you play the input source, or the start of the material you wanted to record may be missing. If you set it too low, the recording may start too early, before you play the external source. Set this parameter to an appropriate level using the level meter.

Click $\operatorname{\mathbf{R} \mathbf{p} \mathbf{l} \mathbf{c} }$ or $\operatorname{\mathbf{O} \mathbf{v} \mathbf{r} }\left( \oplus \right)$ to record-arm the Looper. The $\operatorname{\mathbf{P} \mathbf{l} \mathbf{a} \mathbf{y} }\left( \blacktriangleright \right)$ and $\operatorname{\mathbf{O} \mathbf{v} \mathbf{r} }\left( \oplus \right)$ buttons will then flash.

At that point, start recording by doing either of the following:

- Start performing so that the incoming audio level exceeds the level of the threshold slider.

- Click the Play (D) button in the Looper panel.

Click Rev («) to reverse playback and recording of the Looper.

Use the Bars field to define the length of your loop. Regardless of how much or how little audio you record, this is how long your loop will be.

Click $\mathbf{{Sync}}$ button to sync or un-sync the looper with sequence playback. When $\mathbf{{on}}$ , the Looper will stay in step with your current sequence. When you play or record into the Looper, it will wait until the sequence starts playing Bar 1 to start.

Use the Record To selector to determine the loop recording behavior:

Play: Before recording, you must first click the Play (D) button on the window, which will start playing the Looper.

Overdub: Before recording, you must first click $\mathsf{R}\mathsf{{plc}}$ or $\mathsf{{Ovr}}$ (⊕) to record-arm the Looper.

Click Clear $\times$ to erase the loop immediately.

Click Export $\times$ to open the Export Loop as a Sample window.

Use the Output Gain slider to adjust the Looper’s output gain level. This is the same as adjusting Q-Link Knob 4 in the Q-Links panel.

Below are step-by-step instructions for using the Looper's functions.

## To record with the Looper:

Important:

To record without erasing any audio you’ve already recorded in the loop, use the $\oplus$ /Ovr button.

To overwrite the audio you’ve already recorded, use the RpIc button.

If Record To is set to Play:

To start recording, click the RpIc or Ovr (⊕) button as the loop is playing. The Looper will start recording immediately.

To stop recording, click the Rplc or Ovr (⊕) button. The Looper will stop recording but continue playing.

To stop playback and recording, click the Play (D) button.

If Record To is set to Overdub:

To start recording, click the Play (D) button on the window.

If $\mathbf{{Sync}}$ is off, you can also play your audio source so that the input level reaches the threshold value.

If Sync is on, you can also click the Play (D) or Play Start (D) button in the toolbar to start playing a sequence; recording will start when the sequence starts on Bar 1.

To stop recording, click the Ovr (⊕) button. The Looper will stop recording but continue playing.

To stop playback and recording, click the Play (D) button, or press stop to stop sequence playback.

To play or stop the loop (without recording), click the Play (I) button on the window.

To reverse loop playback, click the Rev (11) button. If Seq Sync is on, playback will reverse once the Looper’s playhead reaches the end of the loop. If Seq Sync is off, playback will reverse immediately.

To erase the loop immediately, click Clear $\times$ .

To export the loop as a sample:

1. Click Export $\times$ to open the Export Loop as a Sample window.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_199_835196.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_199_835196.jpg)

2. Use the New Name field to name the new sample. Otherwise, the process will add a consecutive number after the sample name.

3. Optional: Click the Program menu to assign the new sample to a program. Select <none> if you want to save it to the project without assigning it to a program.

4. Optional: Use the Assign to Pad field to assign the sample to a pad in the program.

5. Use the Root Note field to set where the sample's original pitch will be on the keyboard.

To save the recording, click Save.

To play the recording, click Play.

To close the window without exporting, click Cancel.

To confirm your selections and export the loop, click Do It.

To edit the recording in Sample Edit Mode (recommended), click Edit.

Pad Mute Mode

Pad Mute Mode lets you easily mute pads within a program or set mute groups for each pad within a program.

To enter Pad Mute Mode, do any of the following:

- Click the square-and-X icon in the toolbar (if shown).

- Click the down arrow $\left( \mathbf{\nabla }\right)$ next to the other mode icons in the toolbar, and click Pad Mute.

- Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, and go to View $>$ Mode and click Pad Mute.

The dark blue timeline at the top indicates the number of bars that have elapsed with each sequence. The white arrow $\left( \nabla \right)$ is the audio playhead, indicating the current playback position.

Each block represents a sequence with miniature track note events. The sequence number and name is at the top of each block. A repeat symbol (||:) next to the sequence name indicates it is a repeat of the previous sequence.

Use the sliders in the lower-right corner of this area (along each axis) to zoom in or zoom out.

The lower half of the window can display the Sequence List panel, Pads panel, Performance Controls panel, and Project panel. Click the corresponding selector to show or hide each one. See General Features $>$ Panels $>$ Project to learn more about the Project panel. The other panels are described below: Sequence List, Pads, and Performance Controls.

## Sequence List

The Sequence List panel shows a list of all available sequences in your project as well as their length and tempo. The currently selected one is highlighted. Select one by clicking or pressing its corresponding pad.

<table><thead><tr><th>SEQUENCE</th><th>LENGTHTEMPO</th><th></th></tr></thead><tr><td>1 Sequence 01</td><td>2</td><td>126.00</td></tr><tr><td>2 Sequence 02</td><td>2</td><td>126.00</td></tr><tr><td>3 Sequence 03</td><td>2</td><td>126.00</td></tr><tr><td>4 Sequence 04</td><td>2</td><td>126.00</td></tr><tr><td>$5\;\mathrm{\left( {unused}\right) }$</td><td>2</td><td>126.00</td></tr><tr><td>6 (unused)</td><td>2</td><td>126.00</td></tr><tr><td>7 (unused)</td><td>2</td><td>126.00</td></tr><tr><td>8 (unused)</td><td>2</td><td>126.00</td></tr><tr><td>9 (unused)</td><td>2</td><td>126.00</td></tr><tr><td>10 (unused)</td><td>2</td><td>126.00</td></tr><tr><td>11 (unused)</td><td>2</td><td>126.00</td></tr><tr><td>12 (unused) 13 (unused)</td><td>2 2</td><td>126.00 126.00</td></tr><tr><td>14 (unused)</td><td>2</td><td>126.00</td></tr><tr><td>15 (unused) 16(unused)</td><td>2 2</td><td>126.00 126.00</td></tr><tr><td>17 (unused) ；</td><td>2 】</td><td>126.00 ：</td></tr></table>

The Sequence column shows the name of the sequence.

The Length column indicates the length of the sequence in bars.

The Tempo column indicates the tempo of the sequence in BPM. Keep in mind that each sequence will not play back at this tempo if the Seq/Gbl button in the toolbar is set to Gbl; if it is set to Seq, then each sequence follows its own tempo during playback.

Note: To set the BPM of a sequence, select that sequence and then use (A) the BPM field in its Sequence section of the Inspector or (B) the BPM field in the toolbar (when set to Seq instead of Gbl).

## Pads

The Pads panel represents 16 sequences (per bank). Each pad shows the length of the sequence in bars, the tempo of the sequence in BPM, and the name of the sequence. (Keep in mind that each sequence will not play back at this tempo if the $\mathbf{{Seq}}/\mathbf{{Gbl}}$ button in the toolbar is set to $\mathbf{{Gbl}}$ ; if it is set to $\mathbf{{Seq}}$ , then each sequence follows its own tempo during playback.)

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_207_720451.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_207_720451.jpg)

Click a pad bank to select it.

Click a pad to select its sequence.

As a sequence plays, you can use the buttons in this panel to change how playback works in this mode:

Click Hold to repeat the current sequence indefinitely and temporarily ignore pad presses. Click it again to return to normal operation. This is useful if you want to select other pads without selecting them to play next.

Click Sudden to switch to the currently selected sequence immediately. The new sequence will start playing whether or not the current sequence is done. This is useful in live performances if you need to switch to the next sequence instantly at a certain cue.

Click Next Bar to switch to the currently selected sequence at the beginning of the next bar. This is useful if you want to switch to another sequence before the current one ends without having to worry about timing issues.

If there is a sequence that will play next, you can click Clear to cancel it. The current sequence will continue playing or you can click or press a pad to select another sequence to play next. This option is available only if that sequence is not playing at that moment.

While playback is stopped, you can use these buttons:

While playback is stopped, click Copy to Song to copy the sequence playlist to a song (see the Song Mode chapter to learn about creating a song).

While playback is stopped, click Erase Song to clear all sequences from the upper half of the window.

ja Song Mode lets you arrange sequences in a specific order and/or repetition to create songs. You can edit the structure of a song during playback for easy, on-the-fly composing.

A project can contain up to 32 songs, each consisting of up to 999 "steps." Each step can have an assigned sequence as well as the number of times that sequence will repeat.

To open Song Mode, do any of the following:

- Click the musical-notes icon in the toolbar (if shown).

- Click the down arrow ( $\nabla$ ) next to the other mode icons in the toolbar, and click Song.

- Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, and go to View $>$ Mode and click Song.

Important: If a sequence is currently playing, stop playback before entering Song Mode. You cannot enter Song Mode during playback.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_208_465545.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_208_465545.jpg)

In Song Mode, every pad is assigned to a sequence, starting from $\mathbf{{Pad}}$ A01 with Sequence 1 and ascending from there. In this mode, you can create a song as a list “steps.” Each step corresponds to a sequence and will play a certain number of times.

Important: When creating a song, the program used by each track in the song's first sequence will be used by all subsequent tracks. In other words, all identically numbered tracks (across sequences) will use the program used by the first sequence in the song-regardless of what programs each track uses while not in Song Mode.

For example, if you create a project in this way...:

Track 1 of Sequence 1 uses a drum program.

Track 1 of Sequence 2 uses a keygroup program.

A song uses Sequence 1 as its first sequence and then uses Sequence 2 any time after it.

...then, in that song, Track 1 in Sequence 2 will use the same drum program as Track 1, Sequence 1.

Because of this, we recommend trying to be consistent while creating tracks in sequences that you intend to use in a single song. Remember that you can copy one track to another if you ever need to reorder the tracks of a sequence (see General Features > Editing Processes to learn about this).

The upper half of the window displays a representation of the sequences in the song.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_209_375581.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_209_375581.jpg)

The dark blue timeline at the top indicates the number of bars that have elapsed with each sequence. The white arrow $\left( \mathbf{\nabla }\right)$ is the audio playhead, indicating the current playback position.

Each block represents a sequence with miniature track note events. The sequence number and name is at the top of each block. A repeat symbol (||:) next to the sequence name indicates it is a repeat of the previous sequence.

Click the blue bar at the top of each block to select that step in the song. The bar will be yellow when selected. If the step contains repetitions of a sequence, all repetitions in that step will be selected.

Click the $\mathbf{X}$ in the blue bar at the top of a block to delete that step in the song. If the step contains repetitions of a sequence, all repetitions in that step will be deleted.

Use the sliders in the lower-right corner of this area (along each axis) to zoom in or zoom out.

The lower half of the window can display the Sequence List panel, Pads panel, Song Parameters panel, and Project panel. Click the corresponding selector to show or hide each one. See General Features $>$ Panels $>$ Project to learn more about the Project panel. The other panels are described below: Sequence List, Pads, and Song Parameters.

## Sequence List

The Sequence List panel shows a list of the steps of the song. Each step can have one sequence assigned to it and will show its information. The currently selected one is highlighted. Select one by clicking it.

<table><thead><tr><th>STEP</th><th>SEQUENCE</th><th>RPTS</th><th>BPM</th><th>BARS</th></tr></thead><tr><td>1</td><td>1: Sequence 01</td><td>2</td><td>126.00</td><td rowspan="4">2 2 2 2</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2: Sequence 02</td><td>1</td><td>126.00</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>3: Sequence 03</td><td>1</td><td>126.00</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>2: Sequence 02</td><td>1</td><td>126.00</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>4: Sequence 04</td><td>1</td><td>126.00</td><td>2</td></tr></table>

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_210_419236.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_210_419236.jpg)

The Step column shows the number of the step. Each song can contain up to 999 steps.

The Sequence column shows the number and name of the assigned sequence. Click this menu to select a different sequence. This is the same as the Step menu in the Song Parameters panel.

The Rpts column indicates how many times the sequence plays. Click and drag this field up or down to set the number of repeats. Each step can play up to 999 times. You can set it to Hld (the lowest/minimum value) to set the sequence to repeat indefinitely until you stop playback.

The BPM column indicates the tempo of the sequence in BPM. Keep in mind that each sequence will not play back at this tempo if the Seq/Gbl button in the toolbar is set to Gbl; if it is set to Seq, then each sequence follows its own tempo during playback.

Note: To set the BPM of a sequence, select that sequence and then use (A) the BPM field in its Sequence section of the Inspector or (B) the BPM field in the toolbar (when set to Seq instead of Gbl).

The Bars column indicates the length of the sequence in bars.

## Pads

The Pads panel represents 16 sequences (per bank). Each pad shows the length of the sequence in bars, the tempo of the sequence in BPM, and the name of the sequence. (Keep in mind that each sequence will not play back at this tempo if the $\mathbf{{Seq}}/\mathbf{{Gbl}}$ button in the toolbar is set to $\mathbf{{Gbl}}$ ; if it is set to $\mathbf{{Seq}}$ , then each sequence follows its own tempo during playback.)

<table><thead><tr><th>AB</th><th>CD</th><th>EF</th><th>GH</th></tr></thead><tr><td>A13</td><td>A14</td><td>A15</td><td>A16</td></tr><tr><td>2 bars 126.00BPM (unused)</td><td>2 bars 126.00BPM (unused)</td><td>2 bare 126.00BPM (unused)</td><td>2 bars 126.00BPM (unused)</td></tr><tr><td>AU9 2 bars 126.00BPM (unused)</td><td>A10 2 bars 126.00BPM (unused)</td><td>A11 2 bars 126.00BPM (unused)</td><td>A12 2 bars 126.00BPM (unused)</td></tr><tr><td>A05 2 bars 126.00BPM (unused)</td><td>A06 2 bars 126.00BPM (unused)</td><td>A07 2 bars 126.00BPM (unused)</td><td>A08 2 bers 126.00BPM (unused)</td></tr><tr><td>A01 2 bars 126.00BPN Sequ..e 01</td><td>A02 2 bars 126.00BPM Sequ..e02</td><td>A03 2 bars 126.00BPM Sequ., e03</td><td>A04 2 bars 126.00BPM Sequ..e04</td></tr></table>

The pad whose sequence is assigned to the currently selected step will flash green.

Click a pad bank to select it.

Click and drag a pad onto one of the following locations to use it in the song:

- onto a step in the Sequence List panel or onto a block in the upper half of the window. This will replace its currently assigned sequence with the one you clicked and dragged onto it.

- between two steps in the Sequence List panel or between two blocks in the upper half of the window. This will insert a step at that location and assign the sequence to it.

If a sequence on another pad will play next, that pad will flash yellow.

During playback, the pad with the currently playing sequence will be lit green.

## Song Parameters

The Song Parameters panel shows the available controls for Song Mode. You can use the buttons in this panel to edit the song.

The Total Bars value indicates the length of the sequence in bars.

The Repeats value indicates how many times the sequence plays. Click and drag the Rpts field in the Sequence List panel up or down to set the number of repeats. Each step can play up to 999 times. When this is set to Hold (the lowest/minimum value), the sequence to repeat indefinitely until you stop playback.

The Time Sig value indicates the time signature of the sequence.

The BPM value indicates the tempo of the sequence assigned to the currently selected step in BPM. Keep in mind that each sequence will not play back at this tempo if the Seq/GbI button in the toolbar is set to Gbl; if it is set to Seq, then each sequence follows its own tempo during playback.

To render/export your song as an audio file, click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$ , and go to File $>$ Export and click As Audio Mixdown. See General Features $>$ Audio Mixdown to learn how to use this screen to export your song.

## MIDI Control Mode

You can use MIDI Control Mode to customize what MIDI messages are sent from certain controls on your

田 MPC hardware. This custom "control map" will then work whenever you are in MIDI Control Mode. The edits you make in MIDI Control Mode will be retained with the current MPC project.

This is helpful when using the MPC software as a plugin: you can use MIDI Control Mode to use your MPC hardware to control your host software, and then switch back to any other mode to control the MPC plugin.

To enter MIDI Control Mode, do any of the following:

- Click the MIDI-controller icon in the toolbar (if shown).

- Click the down arrow ( $\mathbf{\nabla }$ ) next to the other mode icons in the toolbar, and click MIDI Control.

- Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, and go to View $>$ Mode and click MIDI Control.

Important: Make sure your MPC hardware is connected to your computer and powered on. MIDI Control Mode is not functional without a connected MPC hardware unit.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_212_586616.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_212_586616.jpg)

In the window, use the following fields and selectors to set each control’s parameters to your preference. The available parameters depend on its type: Pads, Buttons, Q-Link Knobs, and XY Pad. When you have set all of the parameters as desired, you can select another control or enter another mode.

The software window will also display a graphical representation of your MPC hardware. Editable controls show their current MIDI message. Pads and Q-Link knobs show their current MIDI channels.

To select a control to edit, do one of the following:

- Press or turn it on your MPC hardware.

- Click it on the graphical representation of your MPC hardware.

- Click the Control menu in the upper-left corner of the window and select one.

Note: The Control menu may show many more hardware controls than are actually available on your MPC hardware. This is because the list includes all possible controls from all current MPC models (MPC Renaissance, MPC Studio, MPC Touch, etc.).

## Pads

These are the MIDI parameters you can edit for each pad:

<table><tr><td>PAD EDIT CONTROL BANK SETALL</td><td>Pad 1 A</td><td>、 7</td></tr><tr><td>LIGHTLED</td><td>LOCAL</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>MIDI CH</td><td>10</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CC NUMBER</td><td>100</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VELOCITY</td><td>ON</td><td>v</td></tr><tr><td>AFTERTOUCH</td><td>POLY</td><td>、</td></tr></table>

Control: This is the hardware control you are currently editing (Pad 1-Pad 16). Click this menu to select another control.

Bank: This is the pad bank of the current pad (A-H). If you select the Set All box, the pad's messages and parameters will be identical across all eight banks. Click this menu to select another bank.

Set All: Click this box to select or deselect it. When selected, the pad's messages and parameters will be identical across all eight banks. When deselected, the pad's messages and parameters will apply to the current pad only.

Light LED: This determines how the pad's LEDs will behave. Click this menu to select an option:

When set to Never, the LEDs will always be off.

When set to MIDI Input, the LEDs will light up when the software receives a MIDI message that matches the pad.

When set to Local, the LEDs will light up when you press the pad and/or MIDI input is received.

MIDI Ch: This determines which MIDI channel (1-16) the pad will use to send its message to the software.

CC Number: This determines what MIDI Control Change number the pad will send to the software when you press it.

Velocity: This determines whether the pad will be velocity-sensitive (On) or not (Off). When set to Off, pressing the pad will send a note at full-level (127) always.

Aftertouch: This determines how the pad's aftertouch (pressure applied to the pad after the initial press) behaves.

Off: The pad will not send any aftertouch messages.

Channel: If you press multiple pads that have this setting, the aftertouch messages they send will be identical.

Poly: If you press multiple pads, the aftertouch message each pad sends will be independent from the others.

## Buttons

These are the MIDI parameters you can edit for each button:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_214_636251.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_214_636251.jpg)

Light LED: This determines how the button's LED/LEDs will behave. Click this menu to select an option:

When set to Never, the LEDs will always be off.

When set to MIDI Input, the LEDs will light up when the software receives a MIDI message that matches the button.

When set to Local, the LEDs will light up when you press the button and/or MIDI input is received.

MIDI Ch: This determines which MIDI channel (1-16) the button will use to send its message to the software.

CC Number: This determines what MIDI control change number the button will send to the software.

Type: This determines whether the button will behave as a Momentary switch or Toggle (latching) switch.

## Q-Link Knobs

These are the MIDI parameters you can edit for each Q-Link knob:

---

<table><thead><tr><th>COUNNEDTI CONTROL BANK SETALL</th><th>Q-Link 1 、 A v [v]</th></tr><tr><th>LIGHTLED MIDICH</th><th>LOCAL 、 1</th></tr><tr><th>CC NUMBER MODE</th><th>100 ABSOLUTE</th></tr><tr><th>HIGH RANGE</th><th>127</th></tr><tr><th>TOUCHSENSE</th><th>ON</th></tr><tr><th>TOUCHNOTE</th><th>0[C-2]</th></tr></thead></table>

---

Control: This is the hardware control you are currently editing (Q-Link 1-16). Click this menu to select another option.

Light LED: Although you can edit this parameter, it does not actually have a function on your MPC hardware. Click this menu to select an option:

When set to Never, the LEDs will always be off.

When set to MIDI Input, the LEDs will light up when the software receives a MIDI message that matches the Q-Link knob.

When set to Local, the LEDs will light up when you touch or turn the Q-Link knob and/or MIDI input is received.

MIDI Ch: This determines which MIDI channel (1-16) the Q-Link knob will use to send its message to the software.

CC Number: This determines what MIDI Control Change number the Q-Link knob will send to the software.

Mode: This determines how the Q-Link knob will control its parameter.

Absolute: The Q-Link knob's current position determines its parameter's value; moving it may cause its parameter to "snap" to a new position if you're using it to control different parameters in different modes.

Relative: Moving the Q-Link knob will increase or decrease its parameter regardless of its physical position.

Low Range: This is the Q-Link knob's lowest possible value (0-127).

High Range: This is the Q-Link knob’s highest possible value (0-127).

Touch Sense: This activates or deactivates the Q-Link knob's touch-capacitive circuitry.

On: You can touch the Q-Link knob to send a Note On message to the software (this is how your MPC hardware normally works).

Off: The Q-Link knob will not send any Note On messages; it will only send CC messages when you turn it.

Touch Note: This is the MIDI note number the Q-Link knob will send to the software when you touch it (0–127 or C-2 to G8). Touch Sense must be set to On for this to work.

## XY Pad

These are the MIDI parameters you can edit for each axis of the XY pad of your MPC hardware:

<table><thead><tr><th>XYEDIT CONTROL BANK SETALL</th><th>XYFX X-Axis A V</th></tr></thead><tr><td>MIDICH</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>CCNUMBER</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>LOWRANGE</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>HIGH RANGE</td><td>127</td></tr></table>

Control: This is the axis you are currently editing (XYFX X-Axis or XYFX Y-Axis).

Mute: This button determines whether the axis is muted or not. When muted, its MIDI output is disabled. You must be viewing the Settings to do this.

MIDI Ch: This determines which MIDI channel (1-16) the axis will use to send its message to the software.

CC Number: This determines what MIDI Control Change number the axis will send to the software.

Low Range: This is the axis’s lowest possible value (0-127).

High Range: This is the axis's highest possible value (0-127).

## Mother Ducker

Add this effect as an insert to the track you want to have the ducking effect applied to. Use the meters to monitor the level from your trigger input and tweak the Threshold and Ratio parameters to adjust the amount of ducking. The Attack and Release parameters can be used to sculpt the envelope of the gain reduction to achieve exactly the pumping effect you are after. Mother Ducker has eight internal buses so you can set up multiple channel strips with ducking effects from different sources.

## Distortion Fuzz

This popular effect uses hard clipping of the audio signal, which, at extreme settings, can turn a standard waveform into a square wave, producing a "razor" effect.

<table><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value Range</th><th>Default Value</th></tr></thead><tr><td>Dry/Wet</td><td>0–100 (dry–wet)</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Drive</td><td>0–100</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Output</td><td>0–100</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>0–100</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Low-Mid</td><td>0–100</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>High-Mid</td><td>0–100</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>0–100</td><td>50</td></tr></table>

## Distortion Grimey

This is a unique distortion effect that distorts a frequency range in a selectable band.

<table><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value Range</th><th>Default Value</th></tr></thead><tr><td>Dry/Wet</td><td>0–100 (dry–wet)</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Drive</td><td>0–100</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Grime</td><td>0–100</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Center</td><td>0–100</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Width</td><td>0–100</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Resonance</td><td>0–100</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Output</td><td>0–100</td><td>50</td></tr></table>

## Distortion Overdrive

This distortion is designed to sound like a mildly distorting amplifier at medium volumes. It is the smoothest distortion type available.

<table><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value Range</th><th>Default Value</th></tr></thead><tr><td>Dry/Wet</td><td>0–100 (dry–wet)</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Drive</td><td>0–100</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Tone</td><td>0–100</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Output</td><td>0–100</td><td>50</td></tr></table>

## Frequency Shifter

A frequency shifter changes the frequencies of an input signal by a fixed amount and alters the relationship of the original harmonics. This can produce a chorus-like effect as well as very crazy artificial timbres.

<table><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value Range</th><th>Default Value</th></tr></thead><tr><td>Dry/Wet</td><td>0–100 (dry–wet)</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Frequency</td><td>-1000 – 1000</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Asynchrony</td><td>0–1000</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>A Pan</td><td>0–100</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>B Pan</td><td>0–100</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>A Gain</td><td>0–100</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>B Gain</td><td>0–100</td><td>75</td></tr></table>

## Granulator

This effect turns your incoming audio into small grains of sound that can be looped, pitch shifted, and manipulated in new and interesting ways.

<table><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value Range</th><th>Default Value</th></tr></thead><tr><td>Grain Density</td><td>1.0–300.0 grains/sec</td><td>68.0 grains/sec</td></tr><tr><td>Grain Window</td><td>20.0–1000.0 ms</td><td>608.0 ms</td></tr><tr><td>Grain Length</td><td>10.0–200.0 ms</td><td>171.9 ms</td></tr><tr><td>Grain Feedback</td><td>-99.9 – 0.0 – 99.9%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Trigger Randomization</td><td>0–100%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Pitch Randomization</td><td>0–100%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Pitch</td><td>-12.0 – 0.0 – 12.0 semitones</td><td>0.0 semitones</td></tr><tr><td>Fine</td><td>-50.0 – 0.0 – 50.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Stereo</td><td>0–100%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Mix</td><td>0–100%</td><td>34.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Freeze</td><td>Off, On</td><td>Off</td></tr></table>

## Resampler

Resampler is similar to Decimator in that it removes bits from an incoming signal. The difference is that Resampler applies a complex suite of filters and anti-aliasing to attempt to retain the original sound quality. This is a method used by popular vintage samplers and sampling drum machines from the 1980s. Resampler can be used to achieve a "dirty" sound on drum loops, without the harshness of distortion.

<table><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value Range</th><th>Default Value</th></tr></thead><tr><td>Dry/Wet</td><td>0–100 (dry–wet)</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Rate</td><td>0–100</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Decimate</td><td>0–100</td><td>0</td></tr></table>

## Chorus 2-Voice

This effect uses an LFO to modulate the pitch and a delay of the input signal, which are then added to the dry signal. In small amounts, this creates the illusion of multiple voices playing at once. Turn up the Feedback and Amount for more pronounced "shimmering" and "watery" sounds.

## Flanger

A flanger is a modulated delay to emulate the sound created when running two analog tape machines in parallel with a slight time misalignment. Slow Rate settings can produce a "whooshing" jet engine sound, while faster rates result in more of a "warble."

## Phaser 1

This effect applies multiple ganged all-pass filters to create "notches," or sharp spikes, in the frequency spectrum. The frequencies of these all-pass filters are usually modulated by an LFO to create a sweeping sound.

## Tremolo Sync

This effect uses an LFO (synced to project tempo) to increase and decrease the volume of the signal. Depending on the LFO shape, this can produce a smooth wave effect (sine wave) or a stuttering "on-off" effect (square wave).

<table><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value Range</th><th>Default Value</th></tr></thead><tr><td>Dry/Wet</td><td>0–100 (dry–wet)</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Rate</td><td>1 bar – 1/16 triplets</td><td>1/4</td></tr><tr><td>Sine to Square</td><td>0-100 (sine-square)</td><td>0</td></tr></table>

hard-tuned vocal effects.

<table><tr><td colspan="2">This glossary briefly defines and explains many of the technical terms used throughout this manual.</td></tr><tr><td>Aftertouch</td><td>The majority of contemporary keyboards are capable of generating aftertouch messages. On this type of keyboard, when you press harder on a key you are already holding down, a MIDI aftertouci message is generated. This feature makes sounds even more expressive (e.g., through vibrato).</td></tr><tr><td>Aliasing</td><td>Aliasing is an audible side effect arising in digital systems as soon as a signal contains harmonic higher than half the sampling frequency.</td></tr><tr><td>Amount</td><td>Describes to which extent a modulation source influences a given paramete</td></tr><tr><td>Amplifier</td><td>An amplifier is a component that influences the volume level of a sound via a control signal. It can be modulated by a control signal (e.g., generated by an envelope or an LFC</td></tr><tr><td>Attack</td><td>An envelope parameter. This term describes the ascent rate of a time-relevant process (e.g., an envelope from its starting point to the point where it reaches its highest value). The attack phase is initiated immediately after a trigger signal is received (e.g., after you play a note on a trigger pad or a keyboard)</td></tr><tr><td>Bit Rate</td><td>Bit rate (also known as word length), is the number of bits used to store the level information of each single sample slice within a whole sample. The higher the bit rate, the more precise the information about a sample (i.e., its dynamics' resolution). Normal audio CDs are 16-bit. MPC supports full 24-bit resolution.</td></tr><tr><td>Bounce</td><td>When you "bounce" a sequence, track, or program, you are rendering that part of your project as an audio file (as opposed to a MIDI file). The MPC software lets you bounce sequences, tracks or programs as samples (saved to your project’s sample pool) or as full audio tracks (saved to your project’s sample pool and added directly to the current sequence).</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Bouncing a track will render that track after it is sent through its program. Bouncing a program will render all tracks that use that program after they are sent through it. Bouncing a sequen will render all tracks in that sequence after they are sent through their respective programs.</td></tr><tr><td>Clipping</td><td>Clipping is a sort of distortion that occurs when a signal exceeds the maximum value that can be handled by a signal processing system it is fed into. The curve of a clipped signal is depender on the system where the clipping occurs. In the analog domain, clipping effectively limits the signal to a given maximum level. In the digital domain, clipping is similar to a numerical overflow, resulting in negative polarity of the signal’s portions exceeding the maximum level.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">Control Change (Controllers)</td><td>MIDI messages enable you to manipulate the behavior of a sound generator to a significan degree. This message essentially consists of two components:</td></tr><tr><td>- The controller number, which defines the parameter to be influenced. It can range from 0 to 127.</td></tr><tr><td>- The controller value, which determines the extent of the modification.</td></tr><tr><td>Controllers can be used for effects such as slowly swelling vibrato, changing the stereo panning position and influencing filter frequency.</td></tr><tr><td>Cutoff</td><td>The cutoff frequency is a significant factor for a filter. A low-pass filter for example dampens that portion of the signal that lies above this frequency. Frequencies below this value are allowed to pass through without being processed.</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td>synthesizers, drum machines, etc. CV messages are typically used in conjunction with Gate Math. messages (CV messages determine the pitch of notes while Gate messages determine not activation and length). CV messages are sent from the CV out ports of your MPC hardware (e.g. MPC X) and to the CV in ports of your external MIDI device</td></tr><tr><td>Please note that each external MIDI device uses a specific control voltage range, which determines how many volts are used in each octave (e.g., 1V/oct). Be mindful of this when setting it up with the MPC software and/or controller hardware-mismatched voltage ranges can produce unusual/undesirable “re-scaling” of the octaves.</td></tr><tr><td>Decay</td><td>Decay describes the descent rate of an envelope once the attack phase has reached its maximum and the envelope drops to the level defined by the sustain value.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Envelope</td><td>An envelope is used to modulate a sound-shaping component within a given time. For instance an envelope that modulates the cutoff frequency of a filter opens and closes this filter over a period of time. An envelope is started via a trigger, usually a MIDI not</td></tr><tr><td>The classic $\mathbf{{ADSR}}$ envelope consists of four individually variable phases: $\mathbf{{attack}}$ , $\mathbf{{decay}}$ , $\mathbf{{sustain}}$ , and release. Attack, decay and release are time or slope values, while sustain is an adjustable level. Once an incoming trigger is received, the envelope runs through the attack and decay phases until it reaches the programmed sustain level. This level remains constant until the trigge is terminated. The envelope then initiates the release phase until it reaches the minimum value.</td></tr><tr><td>You can see and read about the envelopes used in the MPC software in Operation > Modes > Program Edit Mode > Anatomy of an Envelope</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="11">Filter</td><td>A filter is a component that allows some of a signal's frequencies to pass through it and dampens other frequencies. The most important aspect of a filter is the filter cutoff frequency Filters generally come in four categories: low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-stop These are the available filters in the MPC software:</td></tr><tr><td>A low-pass filter (the most common type) dampens all frequencies above the cutoff frequency.</td></tr><tr><td>A high-pass filter in turn dampens the frequencies below the cutoff.</td></tr><tr><td>A band-pass filter allows only those frequencies around the cutoff frequency to pass. All others are dampened.</td></tr><tr><td>A band-stop filter does the opposite of a band-pass: it dampens only the frequencies around the cutoff frequency.</td></tr><tr><td>A band-boost filter boosts the frequencies around the cutoff frequency, similar to what a band on an equalizer would do. All other frequencies pass through normally</td></tr><tr><td>The number of poles in a filter’s "slope" determines how extreme or subtle the effect of the filter will be. Filters with one or two poles produce a subtler sound while filters with six or eight poles are much more pronounced.</td></tr><tr><td>In the MPC software, the Model filters are analog-style emulations of famous vintage synth filters. Model1 is a four-pole filter that distorts at high input levels. Model2 uses a mellow resonance with a "fattening" distortion in the lower frequencies. Model3 can produce howling, piercing resonances and extreme sub frequencies—watch your speakers!</td></tr><tr><td>In the MPC software, the $\mathtt{{Vocal}}$ filters are formant filters that emulate the human voice. $\mathtt{{Vocal1}}$ produces “ah” and “ooh” vowel sounds. Vocal2 uses three bands to produce “oh” and “ee” vowel sounds. Vocal3 uses five bands to emulate an idealized model of the vocal tra</td></tr><tr><td>In the MPC software, MPC3000 LPF is a dynamic, resonant low-pass filter (12 dB/oct) that was used on the original MPC3000, released in 1994.</td></tr><tr><td>case also see the entry for Resonance, an essential characteristic of a filter’s sound.</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td></td><td>messages are typically used in conjunction with $\mathbf{{CV}}$ messages (CV messages determine the pitch of notes while Gate messages determine note activation and length). Gate messages are sent from the CV out ports of your MPC hardware (e.g., MPC X) and to the CV/Gate in ports of your external MIDI device.</td></tr><tr><td>LFO</td><td>LFO is an acronym for low-frequency oscillator. The LFO generates a periodic oscillation at a low frequency and features variable waveshapes. Similar to an envelope, an LFO can be used to modulate a sound-shaping component</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">MIDI</td><td>MIDI stands for musical instrument digital interface. Developed in the early 1980s, MIDI enables interaction between various types of electronic music instruments from differen manufacturers. At the time a communications standard for heterogeneous devices did not exist, so MIDI was a significant advance. It made it possible to link various devices with on another through simple, standardized connectors.</td></tr><tr><td>Essentially, this is how MIDI works: One sender is connected to one or several receivers. For instance, if you want to use a computer to play a MIDI synthesizer, the computer is the sender and the synthesizer acts as the receiver. With a few exceptions, the majority of MIDI devices are equipped with two or three ports for this purpose: MIDI In, MIDI Out and in some cases MIDI Thru. The sender transfers data to the receiver via the MIDI Out jack. Data are sent via a cable to the receiver’s MIDI In jack</td></tr><tr><td>MIDI Thru has a special function. It allows the sender to transmit to several receivers. It routes the incoming signal to the next device without modifying it. Another device is simply connected to this jack, thus creating a chain through which the sender can address a number of receivers. Of course, it is desirable for the sender to be able to address each device individually. To achieve this, a MIDI channel message is sent with each MIDI event</td></tr><tr><td>MIDI Channel</td><td>This is a very important element of most messages. A receiver can only respond to incoming messages if its receive channel is set to the same channel as the one the sender is using to transmit data. Subsequently, the sender can address specific receivers individually. MIDI Channels 1–16 are available for this purpose</td></tr><tr><td>MIDI Clock</td><td>The MIDI clock message transmits real-time tempo information to synchronize processes among several connected devices (e.g., a sound generator’s delay time to a MIDI sequencer). Note: Audio recording is disabled when receiving MIDI clock sync.</td></tr><tr><td>Modulation</td><td>A modulation influences or changes a sound-shaping component via a modulation source. Modulation sources include envelopes, LFOs or MIDI messages. The modulation destination is a sound-shaping component such as a filter or a VCA.</td></tr><tr><td>Note On & Note Off</td><td>This is the most important MIDI message. It determines the pitch and velocity of a generated note. A note-on message will start a note. Its pitch is derived from the note number, which can range from $\mathbf{0}$ to $\mathbf{{127}}$ . The velocity ranges from $\mathbf{1}$ to $\mathbf{{127}}$ . A velocity value of $\mathbf{0}$ is equivalent to a note-off message.</td></tr><tr><td>Normalize</td><td>Normalization is a function to raise the level of a sample to its maximum $\left( {\mathbf{0}\mathbf{{dB}}}\right)$ without causing distortion. This function automatically searches a sample for its maximum level and consequently raises the entire sample's level until the previously determined maximum lev reaches $0\mathrm{\;{dB}}$ . In general, this results in a higher overall volume of the sample</td></tr><tr><td>Panning</td><td>The process or the result of changing a signal’s position within the stereo panorama</td></tr><tr><td>Pitch-Bend</td><td>Pitch-bend is a MIDI message. Although pitch-bend messages are similar in function to control change messages, they are a distinct type of message. The resolution of a pitch-bend message is substantially higher than that of a conventional controller message. The human ear is exceptionally sensitive to deviations in pitch, so the higher resolution is used because it relays pitch-bend information more accurately.</td></tr></table>

You can have a total of 128 programs in a project.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>There are three kinds of programs that use samples for their sound source. Drum programs are mostly used for creating drum programs and easy and quick assigning of samples to a pad. With keygroup programs, you can use one sample (or more) and spread it across two or more keys and play the sample chromatically over a keyboard. That way, there is no need to sample every key of, for instance, a piano. Clip programs use several samples that can be looped (clips), each of which can assigned to a pad; launching different combinations of clips together lets you create intriguing, layered performances.</td></tr><tr><td>Program Change</td><td>These are MIDI messages that select sound programs. Programs 1 through 128 can be changed via program change messages.</td></tr><tr><td>Release</td><td>An envelope parameter. This term describes the descent rate of an envelope to its minimum value after a trigger is terminated. The release phase begins immediately after the trigger is terminated, regardless of the envelope's current status. For instance, the release phase may be initiated during the attack phase</td></tr><tr><td>Resonance</td><td>Resonance or emphasis is an important filter parameter. It emphasizes the frequencies around the filter cutoff frequency by amplifying them with a narrow bandwidth. This is one of the most popular methods of manipulating sounds. If you increase the emphasis to a level where the filter enters a state of self-oscillation, it will generate a relatively pure sine waveform</td></tr><tr><td>Root Key</td><td>The root key defines the original pitch of a recorded instrument or of a sample. Samples in the MPC software contain the dedicated root key information. This information will be created automatically during recording or importing.</td></tr><tr><td>Sample</td><td>When you tap the pads on your MPC hardware, you can trigger sounds that we call samples. Samples are digitized snippets of audio that can be recorded using the recording (sampling) function of your MPC hardware or loaded from the Browser.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>You can edit and process a sample in different ways. For example, a sample can be trimmed, looped, pitch-shifted or processed, using various effects. When you have finished editing your sample, you can assign it to one or more drum pads to play it. Samples can be either mono or stereo.</td></tr><tr><td>Sample Rate</td><td>This is the frequency representing the amount of individual digital sample scans per second that are taken to capture an analog signal digitally. For normal CD audio recordings, 44100 samples per second are used, also written as 44.1 kHz. The MPC software offers sampling rates up to 96 kHz.</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence</td><td>A sequence is the most basic "building block" of music you can compose in the MPC software. MIDI information from the MPC hardware pads, buttons, and Q-Link knobs are recorded to the tracks of a sequence. Each sequence can contain 128 MIDI tracks and 128 audio tracks. Each project can store up to $\mathbf{{128}}$ separate sequences.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>The length of a sequence can be set from 1 to 999 bars, which would be enough to create an entire song using only one sequence. However, the MPC software has a dedicated Song Mode that lets you chain sequences together to create a song</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Song</td><td>The MPC software’s Song Mode that allows you to arrange different sections (verse, chorus, hook, etc.) in order to build a song. Each song can have up to 999 "steps" (stages in which a sequence may play one or more times). Each project can store up to $\mathbf{{32}}$ songs</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></table>

When you record an audio file, the current sequence tempo will be embedded with it. This information is stored within the sample file when you save the project. When you warp an audio track region, the warping algorithm uses this sequence tempo and the current value in the BPM field to generate the stretch factor.</td></tr><tr><td>Sustain</td><td>This term describes the level of an ${envelope}$ remaining constant after it has passed the attack and decay phases. Once reached, the sustain level is kept until the trigger is terminated.</td></tr><tr><td>Time-Stretch</td><td>See Warp below.</td></tr><tr><td>Track</td><td>A sequence can contain $\mathbf{{128}}$ MIDI tracks and $\mathbf{{128}}$ audio tracks.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Each MIDI track contains MIDI note events and controller data. In this case, the track contains no audio information-only MIDI information that uses the samples in a program (o an external MIDI sound module) to generate its audio. You can edit your performance in many different ways once the performance has been captured</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Each audio track contains an audio signal that has been recorded or imported into your project. You can edit this audio within the software and incorporate it into your sequences alongside your MIDI tracks.</td></tr><tr><td>Trigger</td><td>A trigger is a signal that initiates events. Trigger signals are very diverse. For instance, a MID note or an audio signal can be used as a trigger. The events a trigger can initiate are also very diverse. A common application for a trigger is its use to start an envelope</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="10">Warp</td><td>The Warp feature in the MPC software lengthens or shortens a region of an audio track or sample without changing its pitch. This enables you to fit the length of an audio track or sample to the length of a sequence, a bar in your sequence, etc. while maintaining its original key.</td></tr><tr><td>Please note that the Warp algorithms are very CPU-intensive and can result in audio drop- outs during playback if used too freely. Be mindful of how (and how often) you use the wa unction. You can reduce the CPU resources required by doing any/all of the following</td></tr><tr><td>Minimize the amount of pitch adjustment of warped audio.</td></tr><tr><td>In the Wave Editor, avoid using extreme $\mathbf{{Stretch}}$ values, especially anything below 100.</td></tr><tr><td>Avoid warping very small audio regions</td></tr><tr><td>Warp as few tracks or track regions as possible (i.e., reduce the number of total number of voices of the polyphonic limit that use the Warp algorithm at a given time), especial instances where the warped regions start at the same time.</td></tr><tr><td>Avoid rapidly triggering samples that are warped.</td></tr><tr><td>If you have warped samples used in a drum program, consider using the Flatten Pad function to consolidate the affected pad's layers into one audio sample (see here to learn about this). After you flatten the pad, its sample/samples no longer need to be warped.</td></tr><tr><td>Use a Warp algorithm other than Elastique Pro, which is very CPU-intensive. See Operation $>$ General Features $>$ Preferences $>$ General to learn how to change this.</td></tr><tr><td>Using a higher buffer size (usually above 256) can reduce the possibility of CPU issu See Operation $>$ General Features $>$ Preferences $>$ Audio to learn how to do this.</td></tr></table>

## Snap: Absolute & Relative

While editing a MIDI or audio track, you can now use the Grid Editor to move or copy events using two different ways of "snapping" note events to the grid: Absolute or Relative. (This has been added to Operation $>$ General Features > Editors.)

To switch between Absolute and Relative, click the magnet icon above the grid:

Absolute: Events will "snap" to the nearest time division on the grid (as determined by the TC field or Time Correct window). This is the typical and traditional method of using the snap/quantization feature.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_254_463026.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_254_463026.jpg)

Relative: Events will "snap" to the nearest time division on the grid (as determined by the TC field or Time Correct window) plus the original time position of the event (e.g., an event that is originally three ticks past a time division on the grid will snap only to positions that are three ticks past every time division).

## Pitch Quantization

In a MIDI track, you can now force the pitches of note events into a specific scale. (This has been added to Operation $>$ General Features $>$ Toolbar $>$ Menu $>$ Edit.)

To open the Pitch Quantize window, click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$ , select Edit, and click Pitch Quantize.

Click the Setup menu and select the desired root note of the scale.

Click the Scale menu and select a type of scale.

Click Only apply to selected events to select or deselect it. When selected, only the currently selected note events will be quantized. When deselected, all pitches in the current track will be quantized.

Click the Start note and End note menus and select the lowest-possible and highest-possible pitches (respectively) where the quantized note events will be placed. If a note event is originally outside of this range, it will be forced to the nearest pitch (within the scale) inside the range.

Click Do It to continue or Close to return to the previous screen.

## Step Sequencer: Velocity Adjustment via Q-Links

While using the Step Sequencer, you can now use the Q-Link knobs to adjust the velocity of the note event at each step (while Q-Link Mode is set to Screen). The number of each step will be shown under the corresponding Q-Link knob. (This has been added to Operation $>$ Modes $>$ Step Sequencer $>$ Q-Links.)

To adjust the velocity of each note event, use the corresponding Q-Link knob to select a value (1–127).

To enter a note event at a step, use the corresponding Q-Link knob to change its velocity from 0 (Off) to a value of 1 or greater.

To delete a note event from a step, set the corresponding Q-Link knob to its minimum position, 0 (Off).

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_255_244823.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_255_244823.jpg)

## Faster Attack for Amp Envelopes

In the amp envelope of a drum program or keygroup program, an attack value of $\mathbf{0}$ now produces a much faster response, thus making your drum hits even punchier than before. (You can set the attack value in Program Edit Mode. See Operation $>$ Modes $>$ Program Edit Mode $>$ Drum Programs and Keygroup Programs to learn more.)

Important: Any drum or keygroup programs that you created and saved before this update will load in MPC 2.1 with an attack value of 1 to ensure backwards compatibility.

## Multiple Plugin Windows

You can now view multiple plugin windows at the same time.

## Support for Akai Professional MPD2 & MPK2 Series

The software now supports pad control, pad colors, and bank-switching while using an MPK225, MPK249, or MPK261. It also now supports pad control while using an MPD218, MPD226, or MPD232.

New Features

## MIDI Learn

You can now use the MIDI Learn function to assign areas of the MPC software to external MIDI controllers.

To display the MIDI Learn browser, do either of the following:

- Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, select View $>$ Browser, and then click MIDI Learn Browser.

- In the lower-right corner, click the MIDI controller icon.

To select a MIDI Learn mode, click Global or Project at the top of the browser to show its assignments below. Global MIDI mappings are helpful if you use certain MIDI controllers across multiple projects. Project MIDI mappings are saved within a project, which can be helpful if your MIDI controller usage is particular to each one. See Global or Project below.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_256_334716.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_256_334716.jpg)

## Each assignment has the following settings:

Target: This is the assigned command or parameter. The list of targets in the Global tab is comprehensive, while the list of targets in the Project tab must be added and selected.

Type: This is the type of message: Toggle Button, Momentary Button, Fixed Button, Note, Abs CC, Rel CC Offset, Rel CC 2's Complement. This is automatically detected based on the parameter itself, but you can use this field to assign it manually if it does not detect it properly.

Ch: This is the MIDI channel the control is using.

Data: This is the MIDI note number or CC number.

Flip: Click this box to select or deselect it. When selected, the control’s polarity will be reversed (e.g., a button’s "off" state will become its "on" state and vice versa).

## Project

Use the Project MIDI Learn feature to assign your MIDI controller to various parameters in your specific MPC project:

---

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_259_907293.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_259_907293.jpg)

---

- Mixer parameters such as volume, pan, mute, and solo for MIDI or audio tracks, programs, returns, submixes, and main outputs

- Pad parameters (for drum programs and clip programs only) such as tuning, filter and amp envelopes, layer settings, LFO settings, and velocity

- Program parameters, which depend on the program type

- Insert effects parameters, which depend on the effect type

- Plugin instrument parameters, which depend on the plugin

These assignments will be saved with your MPC project.

Tip: Because these MIDI assignments are saved within a project, you can use them while working with a project on both the desktop version of the MPC software or on your MPC hardware in Standalone Mode.

## To assign a project parameter to a hardware control:

1. Click Learn at the top of the MIDI Learn browser so it turns yellow. (The Enable button will also activate and turn light gray if it is not already activated.)

Click each checkbox to select or deselect its option.

Click and drag each slider left or right to set its value. Alternatively, click anywhere along its length, or click it,

type a value, and press Enter.

Humanize Time determines whether or not humanization will be applied to the timing of MIDI events.

Amount (Pulses) determines the maximum number of pulses by which the timing of an event will be adjusted.

Eagemess determines how dramatically the humanization effect is applied to the timing. Negative values correspond to playing "ahead of the beat" while positive values correspond to playing "behind the beat."

Humanize Note Length determines whether or not humanization will be applied to the duration of MIDI note events.

Length (%) determines how dramatically the humanization effect is applied to note lengths.

Humanize Velocity determines whether or not humanization will be applied to the velocities of MIDI note events.

Strength (%) determines how dramatically the humanization effect is applied to note velocities.

Only apply to selected events determines whether or not these humanization values will be applied to all notes in the track (deselected) or just the currently selected notes (selected).

Click Apply to apply the humanization values while keeping this window open.

Click Do It to apply the humanization values and close the window.

Click Close to close the window without making any changes.

## Generate Random Events

You now create random melodic or drum patterns on the current MIDI track.

To open the Generate Random Events window, click the menu icon (=), select Tools, and click Generate Random Events.

Click the Event Type menu to select the type of events you want to create: Drum events or Melodic events.

Click the Replace menu to select how the events will be created relative to the existing events on the track:

- Replace all events: Select this option to replace all events on the track with the randomly generated ones.

- Replace events in note range: Select this option to replace all events in the designated note range on the track with the randomly generated ones. Use the Bank or Start pad and End pad menus to set the note range for drum events or the Start note and End note menus to set the note range for melodic events.

- Add to existing events: Select this option to add the randomly generated events to the track without replacing or overwriting the existing ones.

Click and drag the Pattern size (bars) field up or down to set how many bars the events will use. Alternatively, click it, type a value, and press Enter. The highest possible value is the number of bars in the current sequence.

Click the Note length menu to select the duration of the events. (This feature is nonfunctional if Legato is enabled while generating melodic events.)

Click Apply to generate the events while keeping this window open.

Click Do It to generate the events and close the window.

Click Close to close the window without generating any events.

If Event Type is set to Drum events:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_261_528900.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_261_528900.jpg)

Click the Bank menu to select the pad bank that will be used to generate the events or select Range to use the Start pad and End pad menus to define a specific pad range instead.

Click the Start pad or End pad menus to define a specific pad range over which the events will be generated. You can use these menus only if the Bank menu is set to Range.

Click and drag the Density (%) slider left or right to set how closely together the events will be placed in the track. Alternatively, click anywhere along its length, or click it, type a value, and press Enter.

Click and drag the Rhythm variation slider left or right to set how widely or narrowly the rhythmic patterns of the generated notes vary. Alternatively, click anywhere along its length, or click it, type a value, and press Enter.

If Event Type is set to Melodic events:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_262_108968.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_262_108968.jpg)

Click the Start note or End note menus to define a specific note range over which the events will be generated.

Click Legato to select or deselect it. When selected, the generated notes will be extended or shortened to create a long, unbroken phrase from the first note event's start point to the last note event's end point. Each note event will sustain until another note event starts. If multiple note events start at the same time (and are not the last note events), their lengths will become identical. When deselected, the generated notes will use the duration set by the Note length menu.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_262_602144.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_262_602144.jpg)

Click and drag the Polyphony field up or down to set the maximum number of note events that can be sounding simultaneously in the track: 1-8. Alternatively, click it, type a value, and press Enter.

Click Constrain notes to scale to select or deselect it. When selected, the notes will be within the scale determined by the Scale menu. When deselected, the notes will be chromatic.

Click and drag the Density (%) slider left or right to set how closely together the events will be placed in the track. Alternatively, click anywhere along its length, or click it, type a value, and press Enter.

Click the Root note menu to set the root note of the scale that the generated notes will use.

Click the $\mathbf{{Scale}}$ menu to select the scale or mode that the notes will use (based on the $\mathbf{{Root}}$ note selection).

## Multiple Plugin Windows Enable/Disable

You can now choose to allow multiple plugin windows to be displayed at the same time (a feature added to MPC 2.1) or to restrict it to single plugin windows (how plugin windows worked prior to MPC 2.1). (This has been added to Operation $>$ General Features $>$ Preferences $>$ General.)

To enable or disable multiple plugin windows, click the menu icon (=), select Edit, and click Preferences. In the Preferences window, click the General tab, and then click Allow Multiple Plugin Windows to select or deselect the option. MPC

## Arpeggiator

MPC now includes a full-featured arpeggiator and phrase player for melodic program types.

## To use the arpeggiator:

1. Set the current track type to Plugin, Keygroup, MIDI, or CV.

2. Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, select Tools, and click Arpeggiator.

To activate the arpeggiator, tap Enable so it is checked. Tap again to Disable the arpeggiator.

To latch the arpeggiator, tap Latch so it is checked. Tap again to Disable Latch.

The Setup section of the Arpeggiator window sets what kind of arpeggiator will be used and its functions:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_276_262216.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_276_262216.jpg)

Use the Action field to set the type: Arp, Note Repeat, Rhythm and Pattern. See below for more details about these types and their additional parameters.

Use the Step Size field to set the note value of each arpeggiator step from $1/1 - 1/{64}$ beats, including $\mathbf{T}$ (triplet) variations. This field is not used in Pattern mode.

Use the Note Length slider to set the length of the played note in each step, from $1 - {100}\%$ .

Use the Velocity field to set the velocity of the arpeggiator notes. Choose As played, From first note, Accented, Full, 3/4, Half or 1/4.

Use the Swing field to set the amount of swing in the arpeggiator from $\mathbf{{50}}\%$ to $\mathbf{{75}}\%$ . Swing lets you "shuffle" your beats - from subtle to extreme.

The Arp mode section of the Arpeggiator window is available when the Action is set to Arp. When this action is selected, hold down a chord and the arpeggiator will play a pattern based on the notes held.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_276_944959.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_276_944959.jpg)

Use the Pattern field to set how the arpeggiator triggers the held notes.

Use the Octaves field to set how many octaves of the held notes the arpeggiator will cycle through.

Use the Variation field to apply rhythmic variation to the set pattern.

The Rhythm section of the Arpeggiator window is available when Action is set to Note Repeat or Rhythm. The Note Repeat action provides traditional MPC Note Repeat behavior. When the Rhythm arpeggiator action is selected, hold down a chord and the arpeggiator will play the held notes in a rhythmic pattern.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_276_416107.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_276_416107.jpg)

Use the Spread field to spread the timing of the held notes, creating a glissando effect.

Use the Rhythm Pattern field to choose the pattern played when notes are held. This is only available for the Rhythm action.

The Pattern section of the Arpeggiator window is available when the Action is set to Pattern. When this arpeggiator action is selected, hold down a single note to trigger a melodic phrase. As you change what note is held, the melodic phrase will be transposed.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_277_424691.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_277_424691.jpg)

Use the Pattern field to choose the pattern.

The Settings section of the Arpeggiator window offers additional options to control the arpeggiator.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_277_115256.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_277_115256.jpg)

If you have a sustain pedal connected, you can enable Sustain Pedal Latches to use it to control latching.

Use the Latch Mode setting to set the latch behavior. When set to Reset, adding a new note(s) will reset the currently latched note(s). When set to Add, new notes will be added to currently latched notes.

Click Close to close the Arpeggiator window.

## Auto Sampler

You can now capture and convert any plugin preset or external instrument preset into a Keygroup sampler patch.

To open the Auto Sampler window, click the menu icon (=), select Tools, and click Auto Sampler.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_278_976418.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_278_976418.jpg)

## Sample Source Information

The Track name and Program name fields show the target track and program that will be sampled. This will be automatically selected as the active track and program when Auto Sampler is opened.

Use the Record from field to select an external or resample input to record from:

To capture the output of a plugin, simply select a Plugin track before opening Auto Sampler.

Note: When a plugin track is selected, the Auto Sampler will only sample the plugin track, regardless of the setting in the Record From field.

To capture a preset from an external instrument such as a sound module, select the Input that the external instrument is connected to.

## Note Range

Use the Min note and Max note settings to determine the lowest and highest notes used to create the sampler patch.

Use the Note stride to determine the range of notes that each sample will cover. For instance, a note stride of 5 means that every 5 notes will utilize a different sample.

Check the Extend min/max notes box to sample all the way to the lowest and highest notes, regardless of the Min Note and Max Note settings.

## Velocity

Tap the boxes next to Layers 1–4 to select how many layers will be used to create the sampler patch.

Use the Velocity value sliders to set the velocity of each layer.

## Sampling

Use the Note length slider to set the length of the sampled note in seconds.

Use Tail slider to set the length of the Audio Tail in seconds. This will add extra seconds to the end of the resulting audio file. This is useful if you are capturing samples whose sounds exceed the defined audio length (e.g., long reverb or delay, one-shot samples with long decays, etc.). We recommend using an audio tail of at least a couple of seconds.

Use Base name to set the naming convention for the samples that will be created by the Auto Sampler.

## Looping

Use the Enable looping field to select how the resulting samples can or cannot be looped:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_279_276511.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_279_276511.jpg)

- Off: The sample will not loop.

- Forward: You can hold down the pad to cause that sample to repeat from the Loop Position to the end of the sample. Release the pad to stop the repeating playback.

- Reverse: You can hold down the pad to cause that sample to play in reverse, repeating from the end of the sample to the Loop Position. Release the pad to stop the repeating playback.

- Alternating: You can hold down the pad to cause that sample to play from the Loop Position to the end of the sample and then play in reverse until it reaches the Loop Position again. This will repeat as long as you are holding the pad down. Release the pad to stop the repeating playback.

Use the Loop start and Loop end sliders to set the starting and ending points in the sample where the loop will occur.

Use the Crossfade slider to set the amount of crossfade between the loop end and loop start in seconds.

Use the Crossfade Type field to select Equal Power or Linear crossfade.

Under On completion, check Make current program to load the completed sampler patch as the current program.

Under Info, the Session Duration field provides an estimate of how long the auto sampling process will take.

Click OK to initiate the auto sampling process. A Progress window will appear. Click Cancel to stop the auto sampling process. Any samples already created will be retained.

Click Cancel to close the Auto Sampler window without continuing.

## Crossfade Looping

You can now add real-time crossfade looping to sample playback.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_280_296209.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_280_296209.jpg)

To apply crossfade looping to a sample:

1. Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, go to View $>$ Mode, and click Sample Edit.

2. Make sure the loop Lock setting is set to Off.

3. Click the Loop menu to select the Forward (FWD) loop mode.

4. Make sure there is at least 10 samples of space between the Start point and Loop point.

5. Use the $\mathbf{X}$ -Fade field to set the length of the crossfade in samples.

6. Click the icons next to the $\mathbf{X}$ -Fade field to select a Linear (straight lines) or Equal Power (curved lines) crossfade.

7. Press Pad A16 - Play Continuous Loop to hear the crossfade applied to the sample.

## Mode Selection Shortcut

You can now press and hold the Menu button on your MPC X, MPC Live or MPC Touch and press a pad to select a menu mode. The pads follow the 4x4 layout of the Mode Menu.

## Q-Link Navigation Enhancements

Q-Link functionality has been enhanced in the following modes: Main Mode, Track View, Next Sequence, Grid Editor, and Audio Edit Mode.

Set the Q-Link Mode to Screen in these pages to access the following controls:

Use Q-Link Knob 2 to adjust the playhead position.

Use Q-Link Knob 3 to scroll through the waveform in the large waveform display.

Use Q-Link Knob 4 to zoom in or zoom out at the playhead position.

Note: For MPC Live and MPC X in standalone mode, the Zoom and Scroll Q-Links are only available in the Grid Editor and Audio Edit Mode.

## Split Events

You can now easily split note events, useful for creating intricate hi-hat parts or quintuplet/sextuplet motifs or drum beats.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_280_135420.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_280_135420.jpg)

To split note events, click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, select Edit, select Track and click Split Events. Select one of the preset number of events (2-9), or click Split Events... to open the Split Events Setup window.

In the Split Events window, you can do the following:

Use the Into field to set the number of events to divide into, from 2-32.

Select Only selected events to only divide the selected note events. When unchecked, all note events in the track will be split.

Click Do It to proceed with splitting events.

Click Close to exit the Split Events window.

## Updates in MPC 2.8

New Features

## MIDI Improvements

MPC now supports multi-MIDI control, making MPC the ultimate MIDI sequencing studio centerpiece.

## Configuring MIDI

To configure the MIDI Inputs and Outputs, go to Preferences $>$ MIDI / Sync.

The Input Ports section displays all available MIDI input ports in a list. Click the port name to rename it to a custom name. This is particularly useful when using multiple devices connected to a single MIDI interface or hub, as you can name the ports according to the devices connected to them. The custom port names will be reflected throughout the software.

Next to each MIDI input port are the Global, Control and Track buttons:

- When Global is enabled, MIDI data from this port will always go to the current track. The MPC Pads are an example of a device that is always Global.

- When Control is enabled, MIDI data from this port will be sent to MIDI Learn.

- When Track is enabled, this MIDI port will appear in the list of available track MIDI Inputs.

The Output Ports section displays all available MIDI output ports in a list. Tap the keyboard icon to rename a port to a custom name.

Next to each MIDI output port are the Sync and Track buttons:

- When Sync is enabled, the MIDI output port will send MIDI sync messages according to the type set in the Preferences menu under MIDI / Sync > Sync Send > Send.

- When Track is enabled, the MIDI output port will appear in the list of available track MIDI Outputs.

Click the $\mathbf{X}$ icon next to a port to reset the MIDI port settings. This cannot be undone.

By default, the Track Enable Ports When Discovered option is set to On so that when any MIDI device is plugged in, the $\mathsf{{Track}}$ option is automatically enabled so the ports can be selected as an available MIDI input or output.

## MIDI Recording

For recording, MIDI Tracks now have an Input Monitor button with four states:

- Off: The track's MIDI input is not monitored, and playback of recorded events will be heard. This setting is useful when using keyboards with Local Control active.

- In: The track's MIDI input is always monitored regardless of the track's Record Arm state, and playback from recorded events will not be heard.

- Auto: The track's MIDI input is monitored when the track is record armed, and playback of recorded events will be heard.

- Merge: The track's MIDI input is always monitored, and playback of recorded events will be heard.

## Copy Pads

You can now copy one or more pads from one drum program to another.

- For Pad Perform modes where there is more than one note per pad (Chords, Chromatic Chords, Progressions), activating 16 levels will apply to the root note of the current chord.

- For melodic programs that are not keygroups, only Velocity, Probability, and Ratchet options are available for 16 Levels.

Five extra chord progressions have also been added to Pad Perform $>$ Progressions.

Pad Perform mode also now supports user-created pad note maps by selecting the Custom type. You can adjust the note map using the Note Mapping tool.

## Key Range, Velocity Range, and MIDI Filtering

You can now configure a track to filter notes outside of a given key range or velocity range, as well as filtering certain MIDI messages. To access track MIDI perform settings:

1. Open the Inspector by doing either of the following:

- Click the $i$ icon in the lower-left corner of the window.

- Click the menu icon $\left( \equiv \right)$, go to View $>$ Inspector, and select Show Inspector.

2. While a MIDI tab is selected, click the $>$ or $\mathbf{v}$ next to the Track field to collapse or expand this section.

3. Click the Key Range field to open the Track MIDI Perform Settings window.

4. In this window, you can adjust the following:

- Note Range: This determines the Note Min and Note Max range that passes MIDI. Notes outside this range will not be heard in the track.

- Velocity Range: This determines the Velocity Min and Velocity Max that passes MIDI. Velocities outside this range will not be heard in the track.

- MIDI CC Filter: Check these boxes to allow the listed MIDI Control Change messages to pass through the track. When unchecked, the MIDI CC message type will be ignored by the track. You can filter the following MIDI CC messages:

CC1 Modulation CC65 Pmento (Portamento) On/Off

CC2 Breath CC66 Sost (Sostenuto) On/Off

CC3 Undefined CC67 Soft Ped (Soft Pedal) On/Off CC4 Foot CC68 Legato Switch CC5 Portamento CC128 Pitchbend CC7 Volume CC130 Program Change CC10 Pan CC129 Channel Pressure CC11 Expression CC131 Aftertouch

CC64 Sustain On/Off

Click the Reset button to reset all filtering options back to default.

## Workflow Improvements and Enhancements

Click Input to view incoming MIDI messages.

Click Output to view outgoing MIDI messages.

Click Clear to clear the current event view.

You can now easily convert a drum sample to a keygroup program. Select the sample and then go to Tools > Current Sample To Keygroup. A new keygroup program will be created on a new track using the selected sample.

From the plugin selector, you can now search for effect and instrument plugins.

The AIR DrumSynth-Multi plugin instrument effect now has assignable mute groups. The accompanying factory presets have been updated to use them.

The AIR Bassline, AIR Electric, AIR TubeSynth, AIR Hype, AIR Mellotron, AIR Solina, and WayOutWare Odyssey plugins have new graphic plugin editors.

MPC now supports Ableton Link v3. Go to Preferences > MIDI / Sync > Sync Receive and enable the Ableton Start/Stop Sync parameter to sync the MPC transport with other Ableton Link devices.

A new setting has been added to Preferences > Hardware > General to set the Shift + Q-Link button behavior to either open the Q-Link Edit window or Cycle Backwards.

References to Master have been renamed Global or Main.

The Drum Program note map is now Chromatic starting from C1 by default.

Arpeggiator settings and XYFX location are now saved and recalled with your MPC project.

The Slice assigned to a drum pad layer can now be automated.

Internal MPC Plugins now also support plugin preset expansion packs.

## New Plugin Effects

MPC now supports five new AIR plugin insert effects, which are available for purchase at thempcstore.com:

## AIR Chorus

This effect is a compact but powerful plugin for classic chorus warmth and depth.

<table><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value Range</th><th>Default Value</th></tr></thead><tr><td>Rate</td><td>0.01 – 10.0 Hz</td><td>1.01 Hz</td></tr><tr><td>Depth</td><td>0.00 – 24.00 ms</td><td>7.10 ms</td></tr><tr><td>Mix</td><td>0–100%</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>Feedback</td><td>0–100%</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-Delay</td><td>0.00–24.00 ms</td><td>2.00 ms</td></tr><tr><td>Wave</td><td>Triangle, Sine</td><td>Sine</td></tr><tr><td>Offset</td><td>-180 – 0 – +180 deg.</td><td>+90 deg.</td></tr></table>

## AIR Expander

This effect is a vital dynamic processor to reduce and remove the unwanted quieter elements of your tracks.

<table><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value Range</th><th>Default Value</th></tr></thead><tr><td>Threshold</td><td>-40.0 – 0.0 dB</td><td>-15.4 dB</td></tr><tr><td>Output</td><td>-20.0 – 0.0 – +20.0 dB</td><td>${0.0}\mathrm{\;{dB}}$</td></tr><tr><td>Ratio</td><td>1:1.0 – 1:100</td><td>1:10</td></tr><tr><td>Range</td><td>0.0 – 40.0 dB</td><td>${40.0}\mathrm{\;{dB}}$</td></tr><tr><td>Attack</td><td>10.0 us – 100 ms</td><td>${1.00}\mathrm{\;{ms}}$</td></tr><tr><td>Release</td><td>10.0 ms – 10.0 s</td><td>166 ms</td></tr></table>

## AIR Multitap Delay

This effect is a versatile, creative delay plugin with a wide range of applications from subtle stereo delays to complex repeating patterns.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_342_960004.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_342_960004.jpg)

AIR Spectral

This unique effect allows you to dig deep into the spectral elements of your sound.

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_342_265241.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_342_265241.jpg)

Note: This plugin "looks ahead" to determine its response, which can produce latency. If this happens, try changing the Latency Adjust setting in the Preferences menu. This may cause some slight latency when playing MIDI notes in your session, though. If you decide to leave latency compensation off, tracks using this plugin may be slightly out of time.

Note: This plugin may consume a lot of CPU, so be mindful of this while using it in your session.

1. First, add a sample to your project by clicking and dragging a file into the sample pool in the MPC software.

2. Open Sample Edit Mode and select the sample to edit by clicking it.

3. In the Functions panel of Sample Edit Mode, click the Create Stems button. You can access this from any of Trim Mode, Chop Mode, or Program Mode.

Alternatively, you can click the Create Stems icon found in the toolbar of serval MPC modes.

4. In the window that appears, use the following options to create your stems:

Click the icons to select or deselect from the following elements to create stems of:

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_345_638539.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_345_638539.jpg)

- Vocals: Isolate vocal elements of the track into a stem.

- Bass: Isolate bass elements of the track into a stem.

- Drums: Isolate percussive elements of the track into a stem.

- Other: Isolate other musical textures, such as keys or guitars, into a stem.

Use the Program dropdown menu to select the program where the stems will be added.

Process Sample

![019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_345_130599.jpg](images/019158f8-5c40-7504-a45c-06e8acd15a42_345_130599.jpg)

The Assign to Pad function determines where the stem separated samples are added. When checked, you can select a pad in the chosen Program using the dropdown menu, and the stems will be added to the four layers of that pad. When unchecked, the stems will be added to the general project sample pool in the Project Info Browser.

Click the Use trimmed sample box to trim the source sample between the Start and End points before applying the stem separation process.

Click Do It to process the sample into stems, or click Cancel to return to the previous page.

5. Once the process is complete, the new stemmed sample files will be added to the Project Info Browser and any assigned pads, if selected.

## Edit All Layers

When multiple stem elements are created and assigned to a pad, each element will be added to the pad as a separate sample layer. To easily edit these stems, a new Edit All Layers button has been added to Program Edit Mode in the Sample Layers panel. When this is enabled, edits made to sample parameters such as Start/End points or Semi/Fine tuning on any one layer are automatically applied uniformly to all four layers at once (even if some layers are empty).
